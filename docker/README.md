## SpaceVim and Neovim in Docker
This Dockerfile builds neovim `HEAD` and installs the latest available version of SpaceVim. You might want to use this for several reasons:

* Have a consistent version of Neovim and SpaceVim as long as the machine supports Docker.
* Try SpaceVim without modifying your current Vim/Neovim configuration.
* Try the latest Neovim with SpaceVim.
* Try SpaceVim with a newer version of Python.
* Debug SpaceVim configurations. e.g. when posting a bug report if you can reproduce it in this container then there's a higher chance that it is a true bug and not just an issue with your machine.

### FAQ
Isn't Docker stateless? Won't I have to reinstall all plugins each time I launch the container?
* During the build we call `dein#install()` so all plugins are installed and frozen. Your custom configurations can be added as an additional build step using the Docker `COPY` command.

### Build
You can build using the supplied `Makefile`:
```
make build
```
or call the command manually using:
```
docker build -t nvim -f Dockerfile.nvim-python3 .
```

### Run
You can run the container using:
```
docker run -it nvim
```
but that isn't terribly useful since changes made inside the container won't be visible outside. More useful is mounting the current working directory inside the container:
```
docker run -it -v $(pwd):/home/spacevim/src nvim
```

Even better is an alias `dnvim` which will do this automatically:
```
alias dnvim="docker run -it -v $(pwd):/home/spacevim/src nvim"
```
