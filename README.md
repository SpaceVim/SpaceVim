SpaceVim is a community-driven vim distribution that seeks to provide layer feature, especially for neovim. It offers a variety of layers to choose from. to create a suitable vim development environment, you just need to select the required layers.

See the [documentation](https://spacevim.org/documentation) or [the list of layers](http://spacevim.org/layers/) for more information.

Here is a throughput graph of the repository for the last few weeks:

## Introduction

[SpaceVim](https://github.com/SpaceVim/SpaceVim) is a community-driven vim distribution with a bundle of modular configuration,
here we call these modules as layers, each layer has different plugins and config, users just need
to select the layers they need. It got inspired by [spacemacs](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs). If you use SpaceVim,
please star it on github. It's a great way of getting feedback and gives me the kick to
put more time into development.

![welcome-page](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13142418/26402270/28ad72b8-40bc-11e7-945e-003f41e057be.png)

If you are new to vim, you should learn about Vim in general, read [vim-galore](https://github.com/mhinz/vim-galore).

## Features

- **Great documentation:** access documentation in Vim with
    <kbd>:h SpaceVim</kbd>.
- **Beautiful GUI:** you'll love the awesome UI and its useful features.
- **Mnemonic key bindings:** commands have mnemonic prefixes like
    <kbd>[Window]</kbd> for all the window and buffer commands or <kbd>[Unite]</kbd> for the
    unite work flow commands.
- **Lazy load plugins:** Lazy-load 90% of plugins with [dein.vim]
- **Batteries included:** discover hundreds of ready-to-use packages nicely
    organised in configuration layers following a set of
    [conventions](http://spacevim.org/development/).
- **Neovim centric:** Dark powered mode of SpaceVim

### Mnemonic key bindings

By default the guide buffer will be displayed 1000ms after the key has been pressed. You can change the delay by setting `'timeoutlen'` option to your liking (the value is in milliseconds).

for example, after pressing `<Space>` in normal mode, you will see :

![mapping-guide](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13142418/25778673/ae8c3168-3337-11e7-8536-ee78d59e5a9c.png)

this guide show you all the available key bindings begin with `[SPC]`, you can type `b` for all the buffer mappings, `p` for project mappings, etc. after pressing `<C-h>` in guide buffer, you will get paging and help info in the statusline.

here is the guide for the default mappings in SpaceVim:

### Unite work flow

![unite](docs/img/unite_mappings.png)

### module statusline

The `core#statusline` layer provide a heavily customized powerline with the following capabilities:, It is inspired by spacemacs's mode-line. and this layer is loaded by default.

- show the window number
- color code for current state
- show the number of search results
- toggle syntax checking info
- toggle battery info
- toggle minor mode lighters

## Documentation

### Quick start guide

SpaceVim load custom configuration from `~/.SpaceVim.d/init.vim`,

:warning: It is not `~/.SpaceVim/init.vim`, user should not change anything in `~/.SpaceVim/`.

here is an example:

```vim
" Here are some basic customizations, please refer to the ~/.SpaceVim.d/init.vim
" file for all possible options:
let g:spacevim_default_indent = 3
let g:spacevim_max_column     = 80

" Change the default directory where all miscellaneous persistent files go.
" By default it is ~/.cache/vimfiles/.
let g:spacevim_plugin_bundle_dir = '~/.cache/vimfiles/'

" set SpaceVim colorscheme
let g:spacevim_colorscheme = 'gruvbox'

" Set plugin manager, you want to use, default is dein.vim
let g:spacevim_plugin_manager = 'dein'  " neobundle or dein or vim-plug

" Set windows shortcut leader [Window], default is `s`
let g:spacevim_windows_leader = 's'

" Set unite work flow shortcut leader [Unite], default is `f`
let g:spacevim_unite_leader = 'f'

" Set Denite work flow shortcut leader [Denite], default is `F`
let g:spacevim_denite_leader = 'F'

" By default, language specific plugins are not loaded. This can be changed
" with the following, then the plugins for go development will be loaded.
call SpaceVim#layers#load('lang#go')

" loaded ui layer
call SpaceVim#layers#load('ui')

" If there is a particular plugin you don't like, you can define this
" variable to disable them entirely:
let g:spacevim_disabled_plugins=[
    \ ['junegunn/fzf.vim'],
    \ ]

" If you want to add some custom plugins, use these options:
let g:spacevim_custom_plugins = [
    \ ['plasticboy/vim-markdown', {'on_ft' : 'markdown'}],
    \ ['wsdjeg/GitHub.vim'],
    \ ]

" set the guifont
let g:spacevim_guifont = 'DejaVu\ Sans\ Mono\ for\ Powerline\ 11'
```

Comprehensive documentation is available for each layer by <kbd>:h SpaceVim</kbd>.

You can also check the [general documentation](http://spacevim.org/documentation/).
