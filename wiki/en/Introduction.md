SpaceVim is a community-driven vim distribution that supports vim and Neovim.  SpaceVim manages collections of plugins in layers.  Layers make it easy for you, the user, to enable a new language or feature by grouping all the related plugins together.

Please star the project on github - it is a great way to show your appreciation while providing us motivation to continue working on this project.  The extra visibility for the project doesn't hurt either!
