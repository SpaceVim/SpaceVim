# Contributing to SpaceVim

SpaceVim is an volunteer effort; we encourage you to pitch in. The community makes SpaceVim what it is.
We have a few guidelines, which we ask all contributors to follow.

You need only consider reading the sections relevant to what you are going to do:

- [Asking for help](#asking-for-help) if you are about to open an issue to ask a question.
- [Reporting issues](#reporting-issues) if you are about to open a new issue.
- [Contributing code](#contributing-code) if you are about to send a Pull Request (PR).

### Asking for help

If you want to ask an usage question, be sure to look first into some places as it may hold the answers:
- <kbd>:h SpaceVim-faq</kbd>: Some of the most frequently asked questions are answered there.
- [SpaceVim documentation](https://spacevim.org/documentation): It is the general documentation of SpaceVim.

### Reporting issues

Issues have to be reported on [issues tracker](https://github.com/SpaceVim/SpaceVim/issues), Please:


- Check the **[FAQ](https://github.com/SpaceVim/SpaceVim/wiki/FAQ)**.
- Search existing issues (including closed!)
- Update SpaceVim to the latest version to see if your problem persists.
- Use a clear title and follow the issue template.
- Include step by step details on how to reproduce it.
