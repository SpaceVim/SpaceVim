INTRODUCTION					*neoinclude-introduction*

*neoinclude* is the framework for |neocomplete|/|deoplete|/|ncm|.

It has "file/include" source and extends tag sources in neocomplete/deoplete/ncm.

==============================================================================

INTERFACE					*neoinclude-interface*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
COMMANDS 					*neoinclude-commands*

:NeoIncludeMakeCache [bufname]			*:NeoIncludeMakeCache*
		Make a cache based on the buffer with the name [bufname].
		The command selects the current buffer when you omit
		[bufname].

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VARIABLES 					*neoinclude-variables*

g:neoinclude#max_processes			*g:neoinclude#max_processes*
		This variable appoints the max number of include processes.
		When this variable is 0, include process will be disabled.

		Default value is 20.

g:neoinclude#ctags_commands			*g:neoinclude#ctags_commands*
		It is the dictionary of the path to the ctags command.  The
		dictionary's key is filetype.  If the key is "_", it will be
		used for default.
		Note: If this command is not installed, "include" source is
		disabled.

		Default value is in "g:neoinclude#_ctags_commands".

						*b:neoinclude_ctags_commands*
b:neoinclude_ctags_commands
		Buffer local variable of |g:neoinclude#_ctags_commands|.

g:neoinclude#ctags_arguments			*g:neoinclude#ctags_arguments*
		It is the dictionary of the character string to set a value
		to give as an argument of the commands when buffer
		and include use a ctags command.  The dictionary's
		key is filetype.  If the key is "_", it will be used for
		default.

		Default value is in "g:neoinclude#_ctags_arguments".

						*b:neoinclude_ctags_arguments*
b:neoinclude_ctags_arguments
		Buffer local variable of |g:neoinclude#_ctags_arguments|.

g:neoinclude#paths				*g:neoinclude#paths*
		It is the variable to enumerate path of the include file
		every file type.  When there is not it, 'path' is used.
		Refer to 'path' for the description form.  It is the
		dictionary of the character string that assumed file type a
		key.

		Default value is in "g:neoinclude#_paths".

						*b:neoinclude_paths*
b:neoinclude_paths
		Buffer local variable of |g:neoinclude#_paths|.

g:neoinclude#patterns				*g:neoinclude#patterns*
		This variable appoints the pattern of the include command.
		When there is not it, 'include' is used.  Refer to 'include'
		for the description form.  It is the dictionary of the
		character string that assumed file type a key.

		Default value is in "g:neoinclude#_patterns".

						*b:neoinclude_patterns*
b:neoinclude_patterns
		Buffer local variable of |g:neoinclude#_patterns|.

g:neoinclude#exprs				*g:neoinclude#exprs*
		It is the expression string of the line analysis to perform
		to acquire an include file name.  When there is not it,
		'includeexpr' is used.  Refer to 'includeexpr' for the
		description form.  It is the dictionary of the character
		string that assumed file type a key.

		Default value is in "g:neoinclude#_exprs".

						*b:neoinclude_exprs*
b:neoinclude_exprs
		Buffer local variable of |g:neoinclude#_exprs|.

g:neoinclude#reverse_exprs			*g:neoinclude#reverse_exprs*
		It is the expression string of the line analysis to perform
		to substitute an include file name.  When there is not it,
		ignored.  Refer to 'includeexpr' for the
		description form.  It is the dictionary of the character
		string that assumed file type a key.

		Example: Perl
>
		if !exists('g:neoinclude#reverse_exprs')
		  let g:neoinclude#reverse_exprs = {}
		endif
		let g:neoinclude#reverse_exprs.perl =
		\ 'fnamemodify(substitute(v:fname, "/", "::", "g"), ":r")'
<
		Default value is in "g:neoinclude#_reverse_exprs".

						*b:neoinclude_reverse_exprs*
b:neoinclude_reverse_exprs
		Buffer local variable of |g:neoinclude#_reverse_exprs|.

g:neoinclude#exts				*g:neoinclude#exts*
		It is the list of include file name extensions.  When there
		is not it, all file name is used.  It is the dictionary of
		the list that assumed file type a key.  In order to use this
		feature you have to initialize 'g:neoinclude#exts' as shown in
		the following example.

		Example: C++
>
		if !exists('g:neoinclude#exts')
		  let g:neoinclude#exts = {}
		endif
		let g:neoinclude#exts.cpp = ['', 'h', 'hpp', 'hxx']
<
		Default value is in "g:neoinclude#_exts".

						*b:neoinclude_exts*
b:neoinclude_exts
		Buffer local variable of |g:neoinclude#_exts|.

g:neoinclude#delimiters				*g:neoinclude#delimiters*
		It is the delimiter character of include path.  When there is
		not it, "." is used.  It is the dictionary of the string that
		assumed file type a key.

		Default value is in "g:neoinclude#_delimiters".

						*b:neoinclude_delimiters*
b:neoinclude_delimiters
		Buffer local variable of |g:neoinclude#_delimiters|.

g:neoinclude#functions				*g:neoinclude#functions*
		This variable appoints the function name of the include
		command.  When there is not it, ignored.  It is the dictionary
		of the function name string that assumed file type a key.

		The function args are {lines} and {path}.
		{lines} is the list of buffer lines.
		{path} is the include path.
		The return value is the list of include files.

		Default value is in "g:neoinclude#_functions".

						*b:neoinclude_functions*
b:neoinclude_functions
		Buffer local variable of |g:neoinclude#_functions|.

FAQ						*neoinclude-faq*

Q: The ctags cache takes too much time.
https://github.com/Shougo/neoinclude.vim/issues/9

A: You can disable it by |g:neoinclude#ctags_command| to empty string.
But you cannot use "include" source.  You can use "file/include" source
though.
