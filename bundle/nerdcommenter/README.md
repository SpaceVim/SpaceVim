### Post Installation

Make sure that you have filetype plugins enabled, as the plugin makes use of **|commentstring|** where possible (which is usually set in a filetype plugin). See **|filetype-plugin-on|** for details, but the short version is make sure this line appears in your vimrc:

```sh
filetype plugin on
```

## Usage

### Documentation

Please see the vim help system for full documentation of all options: `:help nerdcommenter`

### Settings

Several settings can be added to your vimrc to change the default behavior. Some examples:

```vim
" Add spaces after comment delimiters by default
let g:NERDSpaceDelims = 1

" Use compact syntax for prettified multi-line comments
let g:NERDCompactSexyComs = 1

" Align line-wise comment delimiters flush left instead of following code indentation
let g:NERDDefaultAlign = 'left'

" Set a language to use its alternate delimiters by default
let g:NERDAltDelims_java = 1

" Add your own custom formats or override the defaults
let g:NERDCustomDelimiters = { 'c': { 'left': '/**','right': '*/' } }

" Allow commenting and inverting empty lines (useful when commenting a region)
let g:NERDCommentEmptyLines = 1

" Enable trimming of trailing whitespace when uncommenting
let g:NERDTrimTrailingWhitespace = 1

" Enable NERDCommenterToggle to check all selected lines is commented or not 
let g:NERDToggleCheckAllLines = 1
```

### Default mappings

The following key mappings are provided by default (there is also a menu provided that contains menu items corresponding to all the below mappings):

Most of the following mappings are for normal/visual mode only. The **|NERDCommenterInsert|** mapping is for insert mode only.

  * `[count]<leader>cc` **|NERDCommenterComment|**

    Comment out the current line or text selected in visual mode.

  * `[count]<leader>cn` **|NERDCommenterNested|**

    Same as <leader>cc but forces nesting.

  * `[count]<leader>c<space>` **|NERDCommenterToggle|**

    Toggles the comment state of the selected line(s). If the topmost selected line is commented, all selected lines are uncommented and vice versa.

  * `[count]<leader>cm` **|NERDCommenterMinimal|**

    Comments the given lines using only one set of multipart delimiters.

  * `[count]<leader>ci` **|NERDCommenterInvert|**

    Toggles the comment state of the selected line(s) individually.

  * `[count]<leader>cs` **|NERDCommenterSexy|**

    Comments out the selected lines with a pretty block formatted layout.

  * `[count]<leader>cy` **|NERDCommenterYank|**

    Same as <leader>cc except that the commented line(s) are yanked first.

  * `<leader>c$` **|NERDCommenterToEOL|**

    Comments the current line from the cursor to the end of line.

  * `<leader>cA` **|NERDCommenterAppend|**

    Adds comment delimiters to the end of line and goes into insert mode between them.

  * **|NERDCommenterInsert|**

    Adds comment delimiters at the current cursor position and inserts between. Disabled by default.

  * `<leader>ca` **|NERDCommenterAltDelims|**

    Switches to the alternative set of delimiters.

  * `[count]<leader>cl` **|NERDCommenterAlignLeft**
    `[count]<leader>cb` **|NERDCommenterAlignBoth**

    Same as **|NERDCommenterComment|** except that the delimiters are aligned down the left side (`<leader>cl`) or both sides (`<leader>cb`).

  * `[count]<leader>cu` **|NERDCommenterUncomment|**

    Uncomments the selected line(s).
