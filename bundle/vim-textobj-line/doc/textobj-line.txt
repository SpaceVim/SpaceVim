==============================================================================
INTRODUCTION					*textobj-line-introduction*

*textobj-line* is a Vim plugin to provide text objects to select a portion of
the current line.  Sometimes you want to select a portion of the current line
like "^vg_" or "0v$h".  This plugin provides the text objects for such ranges.

For example, if the current line equals to "__foo_bar_baz__" (where "_"
represents a whitespace character), you can select "foo_bar_baz" (without
leading and trailing spaces) by |<Plug>(textobj-line-i)| and "__foo_bar_baz__"
(with leading and trailing spaces) by |<Plug>(textobj-line-a)|.


Requirements:
- Vim 7.2 or later
- |textobj-user| 0.4.0 or later (vimscript#2100)

Installation:
- Recommended way: Use vim-flavor <https://github.com/kana/vim-flavor>.

Latest version:
https://github.com/kana/vim-textobj-line

INTERFACE					*textobj-line-interface*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
KEY MAPPINGS					*textobj-line-key-mappings*

DEFAULT KEY MAPPINGS				*textobj-line-default-key-mappings*

				    *g:textobj_line_no_default_key_mappings*
					    *:TextobjLineDefaultKeyMappings*
This plugin defines the following key mappings by default.  If you don't want
the default key mappings, define |g:textobj_line_no_default_key_mappings|
before this plugin is loaded (e.g. in your |vimrc|).  You can also use
|:TextobjLineDefaultKeyMappings| to redefine these key mappings.  This command
doesn't override existing {lhs}s unless [!] is given.

Modes	{lhs}		{rhs}
------------------------------------------------
vo	al		|<Plug>(textobj-line-a)|
vo	il		|<Plug>(textobj-line-i)|


NAMED KEY MAPPINGS				*textobj-line-named-key-mappings*

<Plug>(textobj-line-a)				*<Plug>(textobj-line-a)*
			Select all characters in the current line without the
			end of line character.  You can select the same
			portion with the following command: 0v$h

			Note that this text object selects nothing if

			* the current line does not contain any character,

			because there is no text to select in the current line.

<Plug>(textobj-line-i)				*<Plug>(textobj-line-i)*
			Select all characters in the current line without
			leading spaces, trailing spaces and the end of line
			character.  You can select the same portion with the
			following command: ^vg_

			Note that this text object selects nothing if

			* the current line does not contain any character, or
			* the current line consists only of space characters,

			because there is no text to select in the current line.
