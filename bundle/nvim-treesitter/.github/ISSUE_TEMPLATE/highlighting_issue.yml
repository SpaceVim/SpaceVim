        # Before reporting
        Please perform the following steps before reporting an issue.
        - I have updated my neovim version to latest _master_.
        - I have updated my plugin to the latest version.
        - I have run `:TSUpdate`.
        - I have inspected the syntax tree using https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/playground and made sure
          that no `ERROR` nodes are in the syntax tree. nvim-treesitter can not guarantee correct highlighting in the
          presence of `ERROR`s -- in this case, please report the bug directly at corresponding parser's repository. (You can find all repository URLs in [README.md](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter#supported-languages).)
        - I have used `:TSHighlightCapturesUnderCursor` from https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/playground to inspect which highlight groups Neovim is using and that legacy syntax highlighting is not interfering (i.e., what you are observing is actual tree-sitter highlighting).

        Please provide the output of `:TSPlaygroundToggle` from https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/playground
        (screenshot or plain text) with the following options enabled (pressing the key):
        - `I` (name of the parsed language)
        - `t` (toggle injected languages)
        - `a` (show anonymous nodes)
