## [0.11] - 2019-11-10
- New features
  - Extensions:
    - [Coc](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim) support
    - [Defx](https://github.com/Shougo/defx.nvim) support
    - [gina](https://github.com/lambdalisue/gina.vim) support

    - [vista.vim](https://github.com/liuchengxu/vista.vim) support
    - [tabws](https://github.com/s1341/vim-tabws) support for the tabline
- Improvements
  - The statusline can be configured to be shown on top (in the tabline)
    Set the `g:airline_statusline_ontop` to enable this experimental feature.
  - If `buffer_idx_mode=2`, up to 89 mappings will be exposed to access more
    buffers directly (issue [#1823](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline/issues/1823))
  - Allow to use `random` as special theme name, which will switch to a random
    airline theme (at least if a random number can be generated :()
  - The branch extensions now also displays whether the repository is in a clean state
    (will append a ! or âš¡if the repository is considered dirty).
  - The whitespace extensions will also check for conflict markers
  - `:AirlineRefresh` command now takes an additional `!` attribute, that **skips** 
    recreating the highlighting groups (which might have a serious performance
    impact if done very often, as might be the case when the configuration variable 
    `airline_skip_empty_sections` is active).
  - airline can now also detect multiple cursor mode (issue [#1933](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline/issues/1933))
  - expose hunks output using the function `airline#extensions#hunks#get_raw_hunks()` to the outside [#1877](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline/pull/1877)
  - expose wordcount affected filetype list to the public using the `airline#extensions#wordcount#filetypes` variable [#1887](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline/pull/1887)
  - for the `:AirlineExtension` command, indicate whether the extension has been loaded from an external source [#1890](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline/issues/1890)
  - correctly load custom wordcount formatters [#1896](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline/issues/1896)
  - add a new short_path formatter for the tabline [#1898](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline/pull/1898)
  - several improvements to the branch, denite and tabline extension, as well as the async code for Vim and Neovim
