INTRODUCTION					*calendar-introduction*

The *calendar.vim* is a modern and ultimate *calendar* application for Vim.

The mattn's |calendar.vim| plugin was a great plugin.
(http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=52)
The plugin provides a calendar window within Vim, with a diary feature, both
vertical/horizontal view and printing week number. The plugin has, as you
guess from the fact that its script id is 52, played an important role to show
the potential of Vim script in its early stage. The only problem is that the
source codes of the plugin are not so clean and hard to modify. Couldn't be
helped. Remember that it was written without using dictionary and list.

My |calendar.vim| plugin basically provides what is provided by mattn's
plugin: calendar of the nearest months, both horizontal and vertical view, and
large-size calendar. Also, this plugin provides many key mappings to move
around the calendar. The default key mappings are carefully designed to match
the default key mappings of Vim itself. Of course, users can freely configure
key mappings in |calendar| buffers.

This |calendar| plugin also supports importing events from Google Calendar.
Once the user connects this plugin to Google Calendar, you can freely edit,
create, and delete events in Vim. The events are automatically synchronized
with Google Calendar.

Moreover, the Julian calendar is supported in this plugin. Basically in the
history of calendars, there are two kinds of calendars: the Julian calendar
and the Gregorian calendar. In most countries (for example, Holy Rome Empire,
France and Spain) the Julian calendar was replaced with the Gregorian in
October of 1582, so the |calendar| adopts this boundary date by default.
However, in the British Empire, it was switched in 1752, and in Russia, in
1918. The |calendar| plugin provides a way to configure the date in which the
Julian calendar is switched to the Gregorian calendar. The plugin also
provides a way to view the Julian calendar in the present day, and vice versa.

CONCEPT						*Calendar-Concept*
This is a calendar which is ...

	Comfortable >
	The key mappings are designed to match the default mappings of Vim.
<
	Powerful >
	The application can be connected to Google Calendar and used in your
	life.
<
	Elegant >
	The appearance is carefully designed, dropping any unnecessary
	information.
<
	Interesting >
	You can choose the calendar in Julian calendar or in Gregorian
	calendar.
<
	Useful >
	To conclude, very useful.

VIM APPLICATION					*calendar-vim-application*
There are lots of Vim plugins. We can classify them as the following groups.
	- colorscheme plugins >
	  (e.g. wombat)
<	- syntax plugins >
	  (e.g. vim-json, syntaxm4.vim)
<	- edit assistance plugins >
	  (e.g. completion plugins, comment plugins)
<	- special buffer plugins >
	  (e.g. VimFiler, TweetVim, gmail.vim)
<	- plugins extending the function of a plugin >
	  (e.g. some unite sources)
<	- plugins supporting other plugins with some low-layer features >
	  (e.g. vital.vim, vimproc, webapi-vim)
<A special buffer plugin creates a special buffer and provides a characteristic
features. For example, file manipulations or interfaces to Twitter. This
|calendar| plugin is one of them.

Now, I'd like to define a new group: Vim application, a subset of special
buffer plugins. A Vim application should:
	- be a special buffer plugin >
	  (create a special buffer and provides some features inside it)
<	- use a buffer as a display for the state of the plugin >
	  (do not get information from the buffer, redraw entirely every time)
<	- provide a rich interface >
	  (for example, window layers composition)
<	- be coded with loose coupling >
	  (any two files do not have common code)
<	- be independent to any other plugins >
	  (all the requirements are included)
<The |calendar| plugin is the first Vim application. So now, it's time to put
up a slogan for the new age of Vim.

COMMANDS					*calendar-commands*

:Calendar [{options}] [day month year]
						*:Calendar*
		Opens a new buffer and views a calendar.
		The order of day, month and year varies according to
		|calendar-options-date_endian|. For example, the argument will
		be judged as [year month day] in Japan (|v:lang| is ja_JP):
		:Calendar 2000		year: 2000,      month: 1, day: 1
		:Calendar 8		year: this year, month: 8, day: 1
		:Calendar 8 5		year: this year, month: 8, day: 5
		:Calendar 2000 8 5	year: 2000,      month: 8, day: 5
		In order to avoid ambiguity, you can use >
		:Calendar -year={num} -month={num} -day={num}
< 		See |calendar-options-year|, |calendar-options-month| and
		|calendar-options-day| for more information.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VIEW						*calendar-view*

This application has some different views. You can switch views with |>| and
|<| keys. Refer to |g:calendar_views| for the default views.

1. Year view					*calendar-view-year*
	This view shows the months. If the window is not wide enough to view
	all the months in the year, it shows the nearest 3 or 5 months.
	The name of the year view is 'year'.

2. Month view					*calendar-view-month*
	This view shows one month. This is the initial view on default.
	The name of the month view is 'month'.

3. Week view					*calendar-view-week*
	This view shows 7 days.
	The name of the week view is 'week'.

4. Days view					*calendar-view-days*
	This view shows 4 days on default.
	The available days views are: 'day_7', 'day_6', 'day_5', 'day_4',
	'day_3', 'day_2', 'day_1' and 'weekday'.


5. Day view					*calendar-view-day*
	This view shows 1 day.
	The name of the day view is 'day'.

6. Clock view					*calendar-view-clock*
	This view shows a digital clock.
	The name of the clock view is 'clock'.

7. Event view					*calendar-view-event*
	This view shows a event list. There are two available event views:
	'event' and 'agenda'.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
KEY MAPPINGS					*calendar-key-mappings*

This application provides a global mapping.
<Plug>(calendar)				*<Plug>(calendar)*
	Open a calendar buffer. This mapping calls the |:Calendar| command
	with no argument.

In the calendar buffer, a lot of mappings are provided.
This application has many views. Thus pressing j triggers various actions
based on the active window. For example, go to 7 days after in the month view,
go to the below month in the year view, 1 hour after in the week and day views,
and the next task in the task window. So the following mappings change its
behavior conformably in each views.

		Add the following configuration to your vimrc. >
		augroup calendar-mappings
			autocmd!
			autocmd FileType calendar nmap <buffer> {key}

			" unmap <C-n>, <C-p> for other plugins
			autocmd FileType calendar nunmap <buffer> <C-n>
			autocmd FileType calendar nunmap <buffer> <C-p>
		augroup END
<
Problem 5:					*calendar-problem-5*
	The frame collapses (on Ubuntu).

		Add the following configuration to your vimrc. >
		let g:calendar_frame = 'default'

			endif
<
Problem 7:					*calendar-problem-7*
	How to change the cache directory.

		For example, add the following configuration to your vimrc. >
		let g:calendar_cache_directory = expand('~/.vim/cache/calendar.vim/')
<		See |g:calendar_cache_directory|.

Problem 8:					*calendar-problem-8*
	The clock stops to update after the cursor gets out of the window.

		causes many problems.

Problem 9:					*calendar-problem-9*
	How to connect to Google Calendar / Google Task.
	How to disconnect my Google account.

		Add the following configuration to your vimrc. >
		let g:calendar_google_calendar = 1
		let g:calendar_google_task = 1

<		See |g:calendar_cache_directory|.

Problem 11:					*calendar-problem-11*
	Which should we use, arguments or global variables.

		Arguments have priority over global variables. For example, if
		you write >
		let g:calendar_first_day = 'monday'
<		the calendar opens with Monday as the first day. However, in
		this situation, if you open the calendar with >
		:Calendar -first_day=sunday
<		Sunday is the first day. So you can write the comfortable
		settings in your vimrc file and give the arguments in order to
		overwrite the settings.

Problem 12:					*calendar-problem-12*
	Found a bug of this application.
	Got many errors while using this application.
	Vim hangs up while using this application.
