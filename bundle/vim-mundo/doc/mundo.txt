1. Intro                                                          *MundoIntro*

You know that Vim lets you undo changes like any text editor. What you might
not know is that it doesn't just keep a list of your changes -- it keeps
a goddamed |:undo-tree| of them.

Say you make a change (call it X), undo that change, and then make another
change (call it Y). With most editors, change X is now gone forever. With Vim
you can get it back.

The problem is that trying to do this in the real world is painful. Vim gives
you an |:undolist| command that shows you the leaves of the tree. Good luck
finding the change you want in that list.

Mundo is a plugin to make browsing this ridiculously powerful undo tree less
painful.

==============================================================================
2. Usage                                                          *MundoUsage*

We'll get to the technical details later, but if you're a human the first
thing you need to do is add a mapping to your |:vimrc| to toggle the undo
graph: >

    nnoremap <F5> :MundoToggle<CR>

Change the mapped key to suit your taste. We'll stick with F5 because that's
what the author uses.

Now you can press F5 to toggle the undo graph and preview pane, which will
look something like this: >

      Preview pane

Your current position in the undo tree is marked with an '@' character. Undo
positions that were saved to disk are marked with a 'w'. Other nodes are marked
with an 'o' character.

When you toggle open the graph Mundo will put your cursor on your current
position in the tree. You can move up and down the graph with the j and
k keys.

You can move to the top of the graph (the newest state) with gg and to the
bottom of the graph (the oldest state) with G.

As you move between undo states the preview pane will show you a unified diff
of the change that state made.

Pressing enter on a state (or double clicking on it) will revert the contents
of the file to match that state.

You can use p on a state to make the preview window show the diff between
your current state and the selected state, instead of a preview of what the
selected state changed.

Pressing P while on a state will initiate "play to" mode targeted at that
state. This will replay all the changes between your current state and the
target, with a slight pause after each change. It's mostly useless, but can be
fun to watch and see where your editing lags -- that might be a good place to
define a new mapping to speed up your editing.

Pressing q while in the undo graph will close it.  You can also just press your
toggle mapping key.

==============================================================================
3. Configuration                                                 *MundoConfig*

You can tweak the behavior of Mundo by setting a few variables in your :vimrc
file. For example: >

    let g:mundo_width = 60
    let g:mundo_preview_height = 40
    let g:mundo_right = 1

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.1 g:mundo_width                                                *mundo_width*

Set the horizontal width of the Mundo graph (and preview).

Default: 45

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.2 g:mundo_preview_height                              *mundo_preview_height*

Set the vertical height of the Mundo preview.

Default: 15

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.3 g:mundo_preview_bottom                              *mundo_preview_bottom*

Force the preview window below current windows instead of below the graph.
This gives the preview window more space to show the unified diff.

Example:

   +--------+            +--------+
   !g!      !            !      !g!
   !g!      !     or     !      !g!
   !g!______!            !______!g!
   !g!pppppp!            !pppppp!g!
   +--------+            +--------+

Default: 0

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.4 g:mundo_right                                                *mundo_right*

Set this to 1 to make the Mundo graph (and preview) open on the right side
instead of the left.

Default: 0 (off, open on the left side)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.5 g:mundo_help                                                  *mundo_help*

Set this to 1 to make help text expanded by default.

Default: 0 (non-expanded help)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.6 g:mundo_disable                                            *mundo_disable*

Set this to 1 to disable Mundo entirely.

Useful if you use the same ~/.vim folder on multiple machines, and some of
them may not have Python support.

Default: 0 (Mundo is enabled as usual)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.7 g:mundo_mappings                                    *mundo_mappings*
                                                        *mundo_map_move_older*
                                                        *mundo_map_move_newer*
                                                        *mundo_map_up_down*

To override any mappings within mundo set the value of the normal mode keys you
would like to use instead (copy the defaults below and adjust as preferred)

Note: mundo_map_move_older, mundo_map_move_newer, mundo_map_up_down options have
been deprecated in favor of settings here.  Although they continue to work, they
will eventually be removed!

Defaults:

let g:mundo_mappings = {
          \ '<CR>': 'preview',
          \ 'o': 'preview',
          \ 'j': 'move_older',
          \ 'k': 'move_newer',
          \ '<down>': 'move_older',
          \ '<up>': 'move_newer',
          \ 'J': 'move_older_write',
          \ 'K': 'move_newer_write',
          \ 'gg': 'move_top',
          \ 'G': 'move_bottom',
          \ 'P': 'play_to',
          \ 'd': 'diff',
          \ 'i': 'toggle_inline',
          \ '/': 'search',
          \ 'n': 'next_match',
          \ 'N': 'previous_match',
          \ 'p': 'diff_current_buffer',
          \ 'r': 'diff',
          \ '?': 'toggle_help',
          \ 'q': 'quit',
          \ '<2-LeftMouse>': 'mouse_click' }

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.8 g:mundo_close_on_revert                            *mundo_close_on_revert*

Set this to 1 to automatically close the Mundo windows when reverting.

Default: 0 (windows do not automatically close)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.9 g:mundo_preview_statusline                      *mundo_preview_statusline*
    g:mundo_tree_statusline                            *mundo_tree_statusline*

Set these to a string to display it as the status line for each Mundo window.

Default: unset (windows use the default statusline)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.10 g:mundo_auto_preview                                 *mundo_auto_preview*

Set this to 0 to disable automatically rendering preview diffs as you move
through the undo tree (you can still render a specific diff with r).  This can
be useful on large files and undo trees to speed up Mundo.

Default: 1 (automatically preview diffs)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.11 g:mundo_auto_preview_delay                     *mundo_auto_preview_delay*

This is the delay in milliseconds before a preview diff is automatically
rendered. The delay is reset whenever the cursor moves. Use this to speed up
undo tree traversal when automatic previews are enabled. Set this to 0 to
disable the feature.

Default: 250

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.12 g:mundo_verbose_graph                               *mundo_verbose_graph*

Set this to 0 to create shorter graphs: the 'o' characters will only be used
when multiple branches exist, and extra lines of '|' are suppressed making for
a graph half as long.

Default: 1 (verbose graphs)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.13 g:mundo_playback_delay                             *mundo_playback_delay*

This is the delay in milliseconds between each change when running 'play to'
mode. Set this to a higher number for a slower playback or to a lower number
for a faster playback.

Default: 60

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.14 g:mundo_mirror_graph                                 *mundo_mirror_graph*

Set this to 0 to align the graph to the left; set to 1 to align to the right.

Default: 1 (mirror graph)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.15 g:mundo_inline_undo                                   *mundo_inline_undo*

When enabled, a small one line diff is displayed to the right of the graph
undo. Although not as detailed as a full diff provided in the preview window,
it provides a quick summary of the diff w/o having to navigate.

Default: 0 (no inline graph)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.16 g:mundo_return_on_revert                         *mundo_return_on_revert*

Set this to 0 to keep focus in the Mundo window after a revert.

Default: 1

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.17 g:mundo_header                                             *mundo_header*

Set this to 0 to hide the mundo header.

Default: 1 (display mundo header)

8. Credits                                                      *MundoCredits*

The graphing code was all taken from Mercurial, hence the GPLv2+ license.

The plugin was heavily inspired by histwin.vim, and the code for scratch.vim
helped the author get started.
