This file exists for testing +cmd supports.
The following is a description of what +cmd copied from Vim's doc

> The [+cmd] argument can be used to position the cursor in the newly opened
> file, or execute any other command:
> 	+		Start at the last line.
> 	+{num}		Start at line {num}.
> 	+/{pat}		Start at first line containing {pat}.
> 	+{command}	Execute {command} after opening the new file.
> 			{command} is any Ex command.
> To include a white space in the {pat} or {command}, precede it with a
> backslash.  Double the number of backslashes. >
> 	:edit  +/The\ book	     file
> 	:edit  +/dir\ dirname\\      file
> 	:edit  +set\ dir=c:\\\\temp  file
> Note that in the last example the number of backslashes is halved twice: Once
> for the "+cmd" argument and once for the ":set" command.

While +cmd support +/{pat}, the test rely on the content. So this file should
not be modified.
