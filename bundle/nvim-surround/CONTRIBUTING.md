Thanks for taking the time/energy to contribute! It really means a lot to me to
know that there are not only people that use my work, but like it enough to
actually help out :heart:

Before we get to actually contributing, a small tangent from me about some of
the goals of this project:

* Provide a *good user experience*, where things behave *as you expect*, which
  means:
  * Use *sane defaults* for the default configuration, and *get community
    feedback* on the user interface
  * Share a *common design language* between features, to reduce the user's
    mental overhead
* Allow for *greater customizability*, to let the users *do what they want*
  * *Document* features and provide *clear examples* on how to use them
  * Keep the code *simple* and *modular*

## Contributing

There are a few main ways to help out:

* Check out the [issues page](https://github.com/kylechui/nvim-surround/issues),
  where active threads that need user feedback will be pinned
* Create a [new
  issue](https://github.com/kylechui/nvim-surround/issues/new/choose), either by
  filing a bug report or opening a feature request
* Respectfully participate in the [discussions
  page](https://github.com/kylechui/nvim-surround/discussions)
  * Give this project your honest feedback on its strengths and (especially)
    shortcomings
  * Try to answer other people's questions, and if recurring, suggest adding it
    to the documentation/wiki
* Help me document this project in the README/help docs/wiki
  * New users can suggest topics to cover in the wiki
  * Existing users of a surround plugin can help document common features, or
    differences between plugins
* Take a look through the list of [open
  issues](https://github.com/kylechui/nvim-surround/issues) and see if there's
  anything that you think you can work on (or open a new issue if it's something
  you would like to see)
  * Get confirmation from @kylechui that the issue is something that would be
    merged into `main`
  * Check out the [For
    Developers](https://github.com/kylechui/nvim-surround/wiki/for-developers)
    page in the wiki, to help you understand the code structure.

Feel free to tag @kylechui at any time for clarification! Thanks again for
stopping by and helping out :sparkling\_heart:
