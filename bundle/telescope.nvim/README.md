## What Is Telescope?

`telescope.nvim` is a highly extendable fuzzy finder over lists. Built on the
latest awesome features from `neovim` core. Telescope is centered around
modularity, allowing for easy customization.

Community driven builtin [pickers](#pickers), [sorters](#sorters) and
[previewers](#previewers).

## Getting Started

This section should guide you to run your first builtin pickers.

[Neovim (v0.7.0)](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/tag/v0.7.0) or the
latest neovim nightly commit is required for `telescope.nvim` to work.

### Required dependencies

- [nvim-lua/plenary.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/plenary.nvim) is required.

### Suggested dependencies

- [BurntSushi/ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) is required for
  `live_grep` and `grep_string`

We also suggest you install one native telescope sorter to significantly improve
sorting performance. Take a look at either
[telescope-fzf-native.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope-fzf-native.nvim)
or
[telescope-fzy-native.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope-fzy-native.nvim).
For more information and a performance benchmark take a look at the
[Extensions](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim/wiki/Extensions)
wiki.

### Optional dependencies

- [sharkdp/fd](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd) (finder)
- [nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter) (finder/preview)
- [neovim LSP]( https://neovim.io/doc/user/lsp.html) (picker)
- [devicons](https://github.com/kyazdani42/nvim-web-devicons) (icons)

### Installation

Using [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)

```viml
Plug 'nvim-lua/plenary.nvim'
Plug 'nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim'
```

Using [dein](https://github.com/Shougo/dein.vim)

```viml
call dein#add('nvim-lua/plenary.nvim')
call dein#add('nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim')
```
Using [packer.nvim](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim)

```lua
use {
  'nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim',
  requires = { {'nvim-lua/plenary.nvim'} }
}
```

### checkhealth

Make sure you call `:checkhealth telescope` after installing telescope to ensure
everything is setup correctly.

After this setup you can continue reading here or switch to `:help telescope`
to get an understanding of how to use Telescope and how to configure it.

## Usage

Try the command `:Telescope find_files<cr>`
  to see if `telescope.nvim` is installed correctly.

```viml
" Find files using Telescope command-line sugar.
nnoremap <leader>ff <cmd>Telescope find_files<cr>
nnoremap <leader>fg <cmd>Telescope live_grep<cr>
nnoremap <leader>fb <cmd>Telescope buffers<cr>
nnoremap <leader>fh <cmd>Telescope help_tags<cr>

" Using Lua functions
nnoremap <leader>ff <cmd>lua require('telescope.builtin').find_files()<cr>
nnoremap <leader>fg <cmd>lua require('telescope.builtin').live_grep()<cr>
nnoremap <leader>fb <cmd>lua require('telescope.builtin').buffers()<cr>
nnoremap <leader>fh <cmd>lua require('telescope.builtin').help_tags()<cr>
```

See [builtin pickers](#pickers) for a list of all builtin functions.

## Customization

This section should help you explore available options to configure and
customize your `telescope.nvim`.

Unlike most vim plugins, `telescope.nvim` can be customized by either applying
customizations globally, or individually per picker.

- **Global Customization** affecting all pickers can be done through the main
  `setup()` method (see defaults below)
- **Individual Customization** affecting a single picker by passing `opts` to
  builtin pickers (e.g. `builtin.find_files(opts)`) see
  [Configuration recipes](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim/wiki/Configuration-Recipes)
  wiki page for ideas.

### Telescope setup structure

```lua
require('telescope').setup{
  defaults = {
    -- Default configuration for telescope goes here:
    -- config_key = value,
    mappings = {
      i = {
        -- map actions.which_key to <C-h> (default: <C-/>)
        -- actions.which_key shows the mappings for your picker,
        -- e.g. git_{create, delete, ...}_branch for the git_branches picker
        ["<C-h>"] = "which_key"
      }
    }
  },
  pickers = {
    -- Default configuration for builtin pickers goes here:
    -- picker_name = {
    --   picker_config_key = value,
    --   ...
    -- }
    -- Now the picker_config_key will be applied every time you call this
    -- builtin picker
  },
  extensions = {
    -- Your extension configuration goes here:
    -- extension_name = {
    --   extension_config_key = value,
    -- }
    -- please take a look at the readme of the extension you want to configure
  }
}
```

To look at what default configuration options exist please read: `:help
telescope.setup()`.  For picker specific `opts` please read: `:help
telescope.builtin`.


To embed the above code snippet in a `.vim` file
  (for example in `after/plugin/telescope.nvim.vim`),
  wrap it in `lua << EOF code-snippet EOF`:

```lua
lua << EOF
require('telescope').setup{
  -- ...
}
EOF
```

## Default Mappings

Mappings are fully customizable.
Many familiar mapping patterns are setup as defaults.

| Mappings       | Action                                               |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `<C-n>/<Down>` | Next item                                            |
| `<C-p>/<Up>`   | Previous item                                        |
| `j/k`          | Next/previous (in normal mode)                       |
| `H/M/L`        | Select High/Middle/Low (in normal mode)              |
| 'gg/G'         | Select the first/last item (in normal mode)          |
| `<CR>`         | Confirm selection                                    |
| `<C-x>`        | Go to file selection as a split                      |
| `<C-v>`        | Go to file selection as a vsplit                     |
| `<C-t>`        | Go to a file in a new tab                            |
| `<C-u>`        | Scroll up in preview window                          |
| `<C-d>`        | Scroll down in preview window                        |
| `<C-/>`        | Show mappings for picker actions (insert mode)       |
| `?`            | Show mappings for picker actions (normal mode)       |
| `<C-c>`        | Close telescope                                      |
| `<Esc>`        | Close telescope (in normal mode)                     |
| `<Tab>`        | Toggle selection and move to next selection          |
| `<S-Tab>`      | Toggle selection and move to prev selection          |
| `<C-q>`        | Send all items not filtered to quickfixlist (qflist) |
| `<M-q>`        | Send all selected items to qflist                    |


To see the full list of mappings, check out `lua/telescope/mappings.lua` and the
`default_mappings` table.

**Tip**: you can use `<C-/>` and `?` in insert and normal mode, respectively, to show the actions mapped to your picker.

Much like [builtin pickers](#pickers), there are a number of
[actions](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim/blob/master/lua/telescope/actions/init.lua)
you can pick from to remap your telescope buffer mappings, or create a new
custom action:

```lua
-- Built-in actions
local transform_mod = require('telescope.actions.mt').transform_mod

-- or create your custom action
local my_cool_custom_action = transform_mod({
  x = function(prompt_bufnr)
    print("This function ran after another action. Prompt_bufnr: " .. prompt_bufnr)
    -- Enter your function logic here. You can take inspiration from lua/telescope/actions.lua
  end,
})
```

To remap telescope mappings, please read `:help telescope.defaults.mappings`.
To do picker specific mappings, its suggested to do this with the `pickers`
table in `telescope.setup`. Each picker accepts a `mappings` table like its
explained in `:help telescope.defaults.mappings`.

## Pickers

Built-in functions. Ready to be bound to any key you like.

```vim
:lua require'telescope.builtin'.planets{}

:nnoremap <Leader>pp :lua require'telescope.builtin'.planets{}

## Previewers

| Previewers                         | Description                                               |
|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `previewers.vim_buffer_cat.new`    | Default previewer for files. Uses vim buffers             |
| `previewers.vim_buffer_vimgrep.new`| Default previewer for grep and similar. Uses vim buffers  |
| `previewers.vim_buffer_qflist.new` | Default previewer for qflist. Uses vim buffers            |
| `previewers.cat.new`               | Terminal previewer for files. Uses `cat`/`bat`            |
| `previewers.vimgrep.new`           | Terminal previewer for grep and similar. Uses `cat`/`bat` |
| `previewers.qflist.new`            | Terminal previewer for qflist. Uses `cat`/`bat`           |

The default previewers are from now on `vim_buffer_` previewers. They use vim
buffers for displaying files and use tree-sitter or regex for file highlighting.

These previewers are guessing the filetype of the selected file, so there might
be cases where they miss, leading to wrong highlights. This is because we can't
determine the filetype in the traditional way: We don't do `bufload` and instead
read the file asynchronously with `vim.loop.fs_` and attach only a highlighter;
otherwise the speed of the previewer would slow down considerably. If you want
to configure more filetypes, take a look at
[plenary wiki](https://github.com/nvim-lua/plenary.nvim#plenaryfiletype).

If you want to configure the `vim_buffer_` previewer (e.g. you want the line to wrap), do this:

```vim
autocmd User TelescopePreviewerLoaded setlocal wrap
```

## Sorters

| Sorters                            | Description                                                     |
|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `sorters.get_fuzzy_file`           | Telescope's default sorter for files                            |
| `sorters.get_generic_fuzzy_sorter` | Telescope's default sorter for everything else                  |
| `sorters.get_levenshtein_sorter`   | Using Levenshtein distance algorithm (don't use :D)             |
| `sorters.get_fzy_sorter`           | Using fzy algorithm                                             |
| `sorters.fuzzy_with_index_bias`    | Used to list stuff with consideration to when the item is added |

A `Sorter` is called by the `Picker` on each item returned by the `Finder`. It
returns a number, which is equivalent to the "distance" between the current
`prompt` and the `entry` returned by a `finder`.

## Layout (display)

Layout can be configured by choosing a specific `layout_strategy` and
specifying a particular `layout_config` for that strategy.
For more details on available strategies and configuration options,
see `:help telescope.layout`.

Some options for configuring sizes in layouts are "resolvable". This means that
they can take different forms, and will be interpreted differently according to
which form they take.
For example, if we wanted to set the `width` of a picker using the `vertical`
layout strategy to 50% of the screen width, we would specify that width
as `0.5`, but if we wanted to specify the `width` to be exactly 80
characters wide, we would specify it as `80`.
For more details on resolving sizes, see `:help telescope.resolve`.

As an example, if we wanted to specify the layout strategy and width,
but only for this instance, we could do something like:

```
:lua require('telescope.builtin').find_files({layout_strategy='vertical',layout_config={width=0.5}})
```

If we wanted to change the width for every time we use the `vertical`
layout strategy, we could add the following to our `setup()` call:

```lua
require('telescope').setup({
  defaults = {
    layout_config = {
      vertical = { width = 0.5 }
      -- other layout configuration here
    },
    -- other defaults configuration here
  },
  -- other configuration values here
})
```

## Themes

Common groups of settings can be set up to allow for themes.
We have some built in themes but are looking for more cool options.

![dropdown](https://i.imgur.com/SorAcXv.png)

| Themes                   | Description                                                                                 |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `themes.get_dropdown`    | A list like centered list. [dropdown](https://i.imgur.com/SorAcXv.png)                      |
| `themes.get_cursor`      | [A cursor relative list.](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim/pull/878)        |
| `themes.get_ivy`         | Bottom panel overlay. [Ivy #771](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim/pull/771) |

To use a theme, simply append it to a builtin function:

```vim
nnoremap <Leader>f :lua require'telescope.builtin'.find_files(require('telescope.themes').get_dropdown({}))<cr>
" Change an option
nnoremap <Leader>f :lua require'telescope.builtin'.find_files(require('telescope.themes').get_dropdown({ winblend = 10 }))<cr>
```

Or use with a command:

```vim
Telescope find_files theme=dropdown
```

Or you can configure it in the pickers table in `telescope.setup`:

```lua
require('telescope').setup{
  defaults = {
    -- ...
  },
  pickers = {
    find_files = {
      theme = "dropdown",
    }
  },
  extensions = {
    -- ...
  }
}
```

Themes should work with every `telescope.builtin` function. If you wish to make
a theme, check out `lua/telescope/themes.lua`.

## Vim Commands

All `telescope.nvim` functions are wrapped in `vim` commands for easy access,
tab completions and setting options.

```viml
" Show all builtin pickers
:Telescope

" Tab completion
:Telescope |<tab>
:Telescope find_files

" Setting options
:Telescope find_files prompt_prefix=🔍

" If the option accepts a Lua table as its value, you can use, to connect each
" command string, e.g.: find_command, vimgrep_arguments are both options that
" accept a Lua table as a value. So, you can configure them on the command line
"like so:
:Telescope find_files find_command=rg,--ignore,--hidden,--files prompt_prefix=🔍
```

for more information and how to realize more complex commands please read
`:help telescope.command`.

## Autocmds

Telescope user autocmds:

| Event                           | Description                                             |
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| `User TelescopeFindPre`         | Do it before Telescope creates all the floating windows |
| `User TelescopePreviewerLoaded` | Do it after Telescope previewer window is created       |

## Extensions

Telescope provides the capabilities to create & register extensions, which
improve telescope in a variety of ways.

Some extensions provide integration with external tools, outside of the scope of
`builtins`.  Others provide performance enhancements by using compiled C and
interfacing directly with Lua over LuaJIT's FFI library.

A list of community extensions can be found in the
[Extensions](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim/wiki/Extensions)
wiki. Always read the README of the extension you want to install, but here is a
general overview of how most extensions work.

### Loading extensions

To load an extension, use the `load_extension` function as shown in the example
below:

```lua
-- This will load fzy_native and have it override the default file sorter
require('telescope').load_extension('fzy_native')
```

You may skip explicitly loading extensions (they will then be lazy-loaded), but
tab completions will not be available right away.

### Accessing pickers from extensions

Pickers from extensions are added to the `:Telescope` command under their
respective name. For example:

```viml
" Run the `configurations` picker from nvim-dap
:Telescope dap configurations
```

They can also be called directly from Lua:

```lua
-- Run the `configurations` picker from nvim-dap
require('telescope').extensions.dap.configurations()
```

## API

For writing your own picker and for information about the API please read the
[Developers Documentation](developers.md).
