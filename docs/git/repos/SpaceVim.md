# [Development](../) >> Git Repository

The source code of SpaceVim is hosted in an online repository and can be cloned locally to view the source code.

```
git clone https://spacevim.org/git/repos/SpaceVim/
```

Since the code was previously hosted on GitHub, old users need to modify the remote repository address manually:

```
cd ~/.SpaceVim
git remote set-url origin https://spacevim.org/git/repos/SpaceVim/
```
