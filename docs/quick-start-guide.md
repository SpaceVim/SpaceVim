This is a quick start guide for SpaceVim, which will tell you how to install and config SpaceVim.
And also provides a list of resources for learning SpaceVim.

If you havenâ€™t seen SpaceVim at all yet, the first thing you should read is this guide.
It will give you a good idea of what SpaceVim is like,

## Install

At a minimum, SpaceVim requires `git` and `curl` to be installed. Both tools
are needed for downloading plugins and fonts.

If you are using Vim/Neovim in terminal, you also need to set the font of your terminal.

### Linux and macOS

```bash
curl -sLf https://spacevim.org/install.sh | bash
```

After SpaceVim being installed, launch `vim` and SpaceVim will **automatically** install plugins.

For more info about the install script, please check:

```bash
curl -sLf https://spacevim.org/install.sh | bash -s -- -h
```

If you got a vimproc error like `[vimproc] vimproc's DLL: "~/.cache/vimfiles/vimproc.vim/lib/vimproc_linux64.so" is not found.  Please read :help vimproc and make it`, you may need to install make (from `build-essential)` and a C compilator (like `gcc`) to build the dll (see issue [#435](https://github.com/SpaceVim/SpaceVim/issues/435) and [#544](https://github.com/SpaceVim/SpaceVim/issues/544)).

### Windows

The easiest way is to download [install.cmd](https://spacevim.org/install.cmd) and run it as administrator, or install SpaceVim manually.

## Run in docker

```sh
docker pull spacevim/spacevim
docker run -it --rm spacevim/spacevim nvim
```

You can also load local config:

```sh
docker run -it -v ~/.SpaceVim.d:/home/spacevim/.SpaceVim.d --rm spacevim/spacevim nvim
```

## Configuration

The default configuration file of SpaceVim is `~/.SpaceVim.d/init.toml`. This is
an example for basic usage of SpaceVim. For more info, please checkout SpaceVim
documentation.

```toml
# This is a basic configuration example for SpaceVim

# All SpaceVim options are below [options] snippet
[options]
    # set spacevim theme. by default colorscheme layer is not loaded,
    # if you want to use more colorscheme, please load the colorscheme
    # layer, the value of this option is a string.
    colorscheme = "gruvbox"
    colorscheme_bg = "dark"
    # Disable guicolors in basic mode, many terminal do not support 24bit
    # true colors, the type of the value is boolean, true or false.
    enable_guicolors = true
    # Disable statusline separator, if you want to use other value, please
    # install nerd fonts
    statusline_separator = "nil"
    statusline_separator = "bar"
    buffer_index_type = 4
    # Display file type icon on the tabline, If you do not have nerd fonts
    # installed, please change the value to false
    enable_tabline_filetype_icon = true
    # Display current mode text on statusline, by default It is disabled,
    # only color will be changed when switch modes.
    enable_statusline_mode = false

# Enable autocomplete layer
[[layers]]
    name = "autocomplete"
    auto-completion-return-key-behavior = "complete"
    auto-completion-tab-key-behavior = "cycle"

[[layers]]
    name = "shell"
    default_position = "top"
    default_height = 30

# This is an example for adding custom plugins lilydjwg/colorizer
[[custom_plugins]]
    name = "lilydjwg/colorizer"
    merged = false
```
