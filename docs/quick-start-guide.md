# Quick start guide

If you haven’t seen SpaceVim at all yet, the first thing you should read is The Quick start guide.
It will give you a good idea of what SpaceVim is like,
show you how to install it, and explain its features.

Upon completing the book, you’ll be an intermediate Rust developer, and will have a good grasp of the fundamental ideas behind Rust.

## Install

At a minimum, SpaceVim requires `git` and `curl` to be installed. These tools
are needed for downloading plugins and fonts.

If you are using vim/neovim in terminal, you also need to set the font of your terminal.

### Linux and macOS

```bash
curl -sLf https://spacevim.org/install.sh | bash
```

After SpaceVim is installed, launch `vim` and SpaceVim will **automatically** install plugins.

For more info about the install script, please check:

```bash
curl -sLf https://spacevim.org/install.sh | bash -s -- -h
```

### Windows

The easist way is to download [install.cmd](https://spacevim.org/install.cmd) and run it as administrator, or install SpaceVim manually.


## Learning SpaceVim

- [SpaceVim Documentation](documentation/). Also known as "The Book", The SpaceVim Documentation will introduce
