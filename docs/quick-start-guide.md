## Requirements

At a minimum, SpaceVim requires `git` and `wget` to be installed. These tools
are needed for downloading plugins and fonts.

If you are new to vim, you should learning about Vim in general, read
[vim-galore](https://github.com/mhinz/vim-galore).

## Install

### Linux and macOS

```bash
curl -sLf https://spacevim.org/install.sh | bash
```

After SpaceVim is installed, launch `vim` and SpaceVim will **automatically** install plugins.

For more info about the install script, please check:

```bash
curl -sLf https://spacevim.org/install.sh | bash -s -- -h
```

### Windows

The easist way is to download [install.cmd](https://spacevim.org/install.cmd) and run it as administrator, or install SpaceVim manually.
