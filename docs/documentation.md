## Core Pillars

Four core pillars: Mnemonic, Discoverable, Consistent and “Crowd-Configured”.

If any of these core pillars is violated open an issue and we’ll try our best to fix it.

**Mnemonic**

Key bindings are organized using mnemonic prefixes,
like b for buffer, p for project, s for search, h for help,
etc…

**Discoverable**

Innovative real-time display of available key bindings.
Simple query system to quickly find available layers,
packages, and more.

**Consistent**

Similar functionalities have the same key bindings
everywhere thanks to a clearly defined set of conventions.
Documentation is mandatory for any layer that ships with
SpaceVim.

**Crowd-Configured**

Community-driven configuration provides curated
packages tuned by power users and bugs are fixed quickly.

## Highlighted features

- **Great documentation:** access documentation in SpaceVim with `:h SpaceVim`.
- **Minimalistic and nice graphical UI:** you'll love the awesome UI and its useful features.
- **Keep your fingers on the home row:** for quicker editing with support for QWERTY and BEPO layouts.
- **Mnemonic key bindings:** commands have mnemonic prefixes like `[WIN]` for all the window and buffer commands or `[Unite]` for the unite work flow commands.
- **Fast boot time:** Lazy-load 90% of plugins with [dein.vim]
- **Lower the risk of RSI:** by heavily using the space bar instead of modifiers.
- **Batteries included:** discover hundreds of ready-to-use packages nicely organised in configuration layers following a set of [conventions](http://spacevim.org/conventions/).
- **Neovim centric:** Dark powered mode of SpaceVim

Neovim on iTerm2 using the SpaceVim color scheme _base16-solarized-dark_

Depicts a common frontend development scenario with JavaScript (jQuery), SASS, and PHP buffers.

Non-code buffers show a Neovim terminal, a TagBar window, a Vimfiler window and a TernJS definition window.

To get more screenshots, see: [issue #415](https://github.com/SpaceVim/SpaceVim/issues/415)

## Concepts

**Transient-states**

SpaceVim defines a wide variety of transient states (temporary overlay maps)
where it makes sense. This prevents one from doing repetitive and tedious
presses on the SPC key.

When a transient state is active, a documentation is displayed in the
transient state buffer. Additional information may as well be displayed in it.

Move Text Transient State:

![Move Text Transient State](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13142418/28489559-4fbc1930-6ef8-11e7-9d5a-716fe8dbb881.png)

## Who can benefit from this?

- **Elementary** Vim users.
- Vim users pursuing a beautiful appearance.
- Vim users wanting to lower the [risk of RSI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repetitive_strain_injury).
- Vim users wanting to learn a different way to edit files.
- Vim users wanting a simple but deep configuration system.

## Update and Rollback

### Update SpaceVim itself

There are several methods of updating the core files of SpaceVim. It is recommended to update the packages first; see the next section.

**Automatic Updates**

By default, this feature is disabled.
It would slow down the startup of Vim/Neovim.
If you like this feature,
add following to your custom configuration file.

```toml
[options]
    automatic_update = true
```

SpaceVim will automatically check for a new version
every startup. You have restart Vim after updating.

**Updating from the SpaceVim Buffer**

Use `:SPUpdate SpaceVim` in SpaceVim buffer. This command will open a new buffer to show the process of updating.

**Updating Manually with git**

You can close Vim/Neovim and update the git repository to update manually:

`git -C ~/.SpaceVim pull`.

### Update plugins

Use `:SPUpdate` command to update all the plugins and
SpaceVim itself. After `:SPUpdate`, you can assign
plugins need to be updated. Use `Tab` to complete
plugin names after `:SPUpdate`.

### Get SpaceVim log

Use `:SPDebugInfo!` command to display the log of SpaceVim.
You also can use `SPC h I` to open a buffer with the
issue template.

## Custom Configuration

The very first time SpaceVim starts up, it will ask you to choose a mode, then it will create a `SpaceVim.d/init.toml` in your `HOME` directory. All User configurations can be stored in your `~/.SpaceVim.d` directory.

`~/.SpaceVim.d/` will be added to `&runtimepath` of Vim.

It is also possible to override the location of `~/.SpaceVim.d/` using the environment
variable `SPACEVIMDIR`. Of course you can also use symlinks to change the location of
this directory.

SpaceVim also support local config file for project, the init file is `.SpaceVim.d/init.toml`
in the root of your project. `.SpaceVim.d/` will also be added into runtimepath.

All SpaceVim options can be found in `:h SpaceVim-config`, the key is same as
the option name with the prefix `g:spacevim_` being removed.

Comprehensive documentation is available for each layer by `:h SpaceVim`.

**Add custom plugins**

If you want to add plugins from github, just add the repo name to the `custom_plugins` section:

```toml
[[custom_plugins]]
name = "lilydjwg/colorizer"
on_cmd = ["ColorHighlight", "ColorToggle"]
merged = false
```

`on_cmd` option means this plugin will be loaded only when the following commands are called. For more options see `:h dein-options`.

**disable existing plugins**

If you want to disable plugins which are added by SpaceVim, you can use SpaceVim `disabled_plugins` options:

```toml
[options]
# NOTE: the value should be a list, and each item is the name of the plugin.
disabled_plugins = ["clighter", "clighter8"]
```

### Bootstrap Functions

SpaceVim provides two kinds of bootstrap functions
for custom configurations and key bindings,
namely `bootstrap_before` and `bootstrap_after`.
To enable them you need to add `bootstrap_before = "myspacevim#before"` and/or `bootstrap_after = "myspacevim#after"` to `[options]` section in file `.SpaceVim.d/init.toml`. The difference is that these two functions will be called before or after the loading of SpaceVim's main scripts as they named.

The bootstrap functions should be placed to the `autoload` directory in `runtimepath`, please refer to `:h autoload-functions` for further instructions. In our case, create file `.SpaceVim.d/autoload/myspacevim.vim` with contents for example

```vim
function! myspacevim#before() abort
let g:neomake_enabled_c_makers = ['clang']
nnoremap jk <Esc>
endfunction

function! myspacevim#after() abort
iunmap jk
endfunction
```

The `bootstrap_before` will be called after custom configuration file is loaded.
And the `bootstrap_after` will be called after Vim Enter autocmd.

If you want to add custom `SPC` prefix key bindings, you can add them to bootstrap function, **be sure** the key bindings are not used in SpaceVim.

```vim
function! myspacevim#before() abort
call SpaceVim#custom#SPCGroupName(['G'], '+TestGroup')
call SpaceVim#custom#SPC('nore', ['G', 't'], 'echom 1', 'echomessage 1', 1)
endfunction
```

### Vim compatible mode

The different key bindings between SpaceVim and origin vim are shown as below.

- The `s` key does replace cursor char, but in SpaceVim it is the `Window` key
  bindings specific leader in **Normal** mode. This leader change be changed via
  `windows_leader` option which use `s` as default variable. If you still prefer the origin function of `s`,
  you can use an empty string to disable this feature.

  ```toml
  [options]
      windows_leader = ''
  ```

- The `,` key does repeat last `f`, `F`, `t` and `T` in vim, but in SpaceVim it is the language specified Leader key.
  To disable this feature, set the option `enable_language_specific_leader` to `false`.

  ```toml
  [options]
      enable_language_specific_leader = false
  ```

- The `q` key does recording, but in SpaceVim it is used to close current window.
  The option for setting key binding to close current window is `windows_smartclose`,
  and the default valuable is `q`.
  If you prefer to use the origin function of `q`, you can use an empty string to disable this feature.

  ```toml
  [options]
      windows_smartclose = ''
  ```

- The `Ctrl-a` binding on the command line can auto-complete variable names, but in SpaceVim it moves to the cursor to the beginning of the command line.
- The `Ctrl-b` binding on the command line is mapped to `<Left>`, which will move cursor to the left.
- The `Ctrl-f` binding on the command line is mapped to `<Right>`, which will move cursor to the right.

SpaceVim provides a vimcompatible mode, in vimcompatible mode, all the differences above will disappear.
You can enable the vimcompatible mode via adding `vimcompatible = true` to `[options]` section.

If you want to disable any differences above, use the relevant options.
For example, in order to disable language specific leader, you may add the following lines to your configuration file:

```toml
[options]
    enable_language_specific_leader = false
```

[Send a PR](http://spacevim.org/development/) to add the differences you found in this section.

### Private Layers

This section is an overview of layers. A more extensive introduction to writing configuration layers can be found in [SpaceVim's layers page](http://spacevim.org/layers/) (recommended reading!).

**Purpose**

Layers help collect related packages together to provide features. For example, the `lang#python` layer provides auto-completion, syntax checking, and REPL support for python files. This approach helps keep configuration organized and reduces overhead for users by keeping them from having to think about what packages to install. To install all the `python` features users only need to add the `lang#python` layer to their custom configuration file.

**Structure**

In SpaceVim, a layer is a single file. In a layer, for example, `autocomplete` layer, the file is `autoload/SpaceVim/layers/autocomplete.vim`, and there are three public functions:

- `SpaceVim#layers#autocomplete#plugins()`: return a list of plugins used in this plugins.
- `SpaceVim#layers#autocomplete#config()`: layer config, such as key bindings and autocmds.
- `SpaceVim#layers#autocomplete#set_variable()`: function for setting layer options.

### Debug upstream plugins

If you found one of the built-in plugins has bugs, and you want to debug that plugin. You can follow these steps:

1. Disable this plugin
   Take disabling neomake.vim for instance:

```toml
[options]
disabled_plugins = ["neomake.vim"]
```

2. Add a forked plugin or add a local plugin
   Use toml file to add custom forked plugins:

```toml
[[custom_plugins]]
name = "wsdjeg/neomake.vim"
# note: you need to disable merged feature
merged = false
```

Use the `bootstrap_before` function to add local plugin:

```vim
function! myspacevim#before() abort
set rtp+=~/path/to/your/localplugin
endfunction
```

## Interface elements

SpaceVim has a minimalistic and distraction free UI:

- custom airline with color feedback according to current check status
- custom icon in sign column and error feedbacks for checker.

### Colorschemes

The default colorscheme of SpaceVim is [gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox).
There are two variants of this colorscheme, a dark one and a light one. Some aspects
of these colorscheme can be customized in the custom configuration file, read `:h gruvbox`.

It is possible to define your default themes in your `~/.SpaceVim.d/init.toml` with
the variable colorschemes. For instance, to specify `desert`:

```toml
[options]
colorscheme = "desert"
colorscheme_bg = "dark"
```

| Mappings  | Descriptions                                                   |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `SPC T n` | switch to next random colorscheme listed in colorscheme layer. |
| `SPC T s` | select a theme using a unite buffer.                           |

All the included colorschemes can be found in [colorscheme layer](../layers/colorscheme/).

SpaceVim supports true colors in terminal, and it is disabled by default, to enable this feature,
you should make sure your terminal supports true colors.
For more information see: [Colours in terminal](https://gist.github.com/XVilka/8346728).

If your terminal does not support true colors, you can disable SpaceVim true colors feature in `[options]` section:

```toml
enable_guicolors = false
```

### Font

The default font used by SpaceVim is [SourceCodePro Nerd Font Mono](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/download/v2.1.0/SourceCodePro.zip).
It is recommended to install it on your system if you wish to use it.

To change the default font set the variable `guifont` in your `~/.SpaceVim.d/init.toml` file. By default its value is:

```toml
guifont = "SourceCodePro Nerd Font Mono:h11"
```

If the specified font is not found, the fallback one will be used (depends on your system).
Also note that changing this value has no effect if you are running Vim/Neovim in terminal.

### UI Toggles

Some UI indicators can be toggled on and off (toggles start with t and T):

| Key Bindings | Descriptions                                             |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `SPC t 8`    | highlight any character past the 80th column             |
| `SPC t f`    | display the fill column (by default `max_column` is 120) |
| `SPC t h h`  | toggle highlight of the current line                     |
| `SPC t h i`  | toggle highlight indentation levels (TODO)               |
| `SPC t h c`  | toggle highlight indentation current column              |
| `SPC t h s`  | toggle syntax highlighting                               |

| `SPC t t`    | open tabs manager                                        |
| `SPC T ~`    | display ~ in the fringe on empty lines                   |
| `SPC T F`    | toggle frame fullscreen                                  |
| `SPC T f`    | toggle display of the fringe                             |
| `SPC T m`    | toggle menu bar                                          |
| `SPC T t`    | toggle tool bar                                          |

### Statusline

The `core#statusline` layer provides a heavily customized powerline with the following capabilities:

- show the window number
- show the current mode
- color code for current state
- show the index of searching result
- toggle syntax checking info
- toggle battery info
- toggle minor mode lighters
- show VCS information (branch, hunk summary) (need `git` and `VersionControl` layer)

| Key Bindings | Descriptions                                 |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| `SPC [1-9]`  | jump to the windows with the specific number |

Reminder of the color codes for the states:

| Mode    | Color  |
| ------- | ------ |
| Normal  | Grey   |
| Insert  | Blue   |
| Visual  | Orange |
| Replace | Aqua   |

All the colors based on the current colorscheme

Some elements can be dynamically toggled:

| Key Bindings | Descriptions                                                        |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `SPC t m b`  | toggle the battery status (need to install acpi)                    |
| `SPC t m c`  | toggle the org task clock (available in org layer)(TODO)            |
| `SPC t m i`  | toggle the input method                                             |
| `SPC t m m`  | toggle the minor mode lighters                                      |
| `SPC t m M`  | toggle the major mode                                               |
| `SPC t m n`  | toggle the cat! (If colors layer is declared in your dotfile)(TODO) |
| `SPC t m p`  | toggle the cursor position                                          |
| `SPC t m t`  | toggle the time                                                     |
| `SPC t m d`  | toggle the date                                                     |
| `SPC t m T`  | toggle the mode line itself                                         |
| `SPC t m v`  | toggle the version control info                                     |

**nerd font installation:**

By default SpaceVim use nerd-fonts, please read the documentation of nerd fonts.

**syntax checking integration:**

When syntax checking minor mode is enabled, a new element appears showing the number of errors, warnings.

**Search index integration:**

Search index shows the number of occurrence when performing a search via `/` or `?`. SpaceVim integrates nicely the search status by displaying it temporarily when n or N are being pressed. See the 20/22 segment on the screenshot below.

![search status](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13142418/26313080/578cc68c-3f3c-11e7-9259-a27419d49572.png)

Search index is provided by `incsearch` layer, to enable this layer:

```toml
[layers]
    name = "incsearch"
```

**Battery status integration:**

_acpi_ displays the percentage of total charge of the battery as well as the time remaining to charge or discharge completely the battery.

A color code is used for the battery status:

| Battery State | Color  |
| ------------- | ------ |
| Charging      | Green  |
| Discharging   | Orange |
| Critical      | Red    |

All the colors are based on the current colorscheme.

**Statusline separators:**

It is possible to easily customize the statusline separator by setting the `statusline_separator` variable in your custom configuration file and then redraw the statusline. For instance if you want to set back the separator to the well-known arrow separator add the following snippet to your configuration file:

```toml
statusline_separator = 'arrow'
```

Here is an exhaustive set of screenshots for all the available separator:

| Separator | Screenshot                                                                                                                |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `arrow`   | ![separator-arrow](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13142418/26234639/b28bdc04-3c98-11e7-937e-641c9d85c493.png) |

**Minor Modes:**

The minor mode area can be toggled on and off with `SPC t m m`.

Unicode symbols are displayed by default. Add `statusline_unicode_symbols = false` to your custom configuration file, statusline will display ASCII characters instead (may be useful in terminal if you cannot set an appropriate font).

The letters displayed in the statusline correspond to the key bindings used to toggle them.

| Key Bindings | Unicode | ASCII | Mode                                          |
| ------------ | ------- | ----- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `SPC t 8`    | ⑧       | 8     | toggle highlight of characters for long lines |

**colorscheme of statusline:**

By default SpaceVim only support colorschemes which has been included in [colorscheme layer](../layers/colorscheme/).

If you want to contribute theme please check the template of a statusline theme.

```vim
" the theme colors should be
" [
"    \ [ a_guifg,  a_guibg,  a_ctermfg,  a_ctermbg],
"    \ [ b_guifg,  b_guibg,  b_ctermfg,  b_ctermbg],
"    \ [ c_guifg,  c_guibg,  c_ctermfg,  c_ctermbg],
"    \ [ z_guibg,  z_ctermbg],
"    \ [ i_guifg,  i_guibg,  i_ctermfg,  i_ctermbg],
"    \ [ v_guifg,  v_guibg,  v_ctermfg,  v_ctermbg],
"    \ [ r_guifg,  r_guibg,  r_ctermfg,  r_ctermbg],
"    \ [ ii_guifg, ii_guibg, ii_ctermfg, ii_ctermbg],

return [
\ ['#282828', '#a89984', 246, 235],
\ ['#a89984', '#504945', 239, 246],
\ ['#a89984', '#3c3836', 237, 246],
\ ['#665c54', 241],

\ ['#282828', '#8f3f71', 235, 132],
\ ]
endfunction
```

This example is the gruvbox colorscheme, if you want to use same colors when
switching between different colorschemes, you may need to set
`custom_color_palette` in your custom configuration file. For example:

```toml
custom_color_palette = [
["#282828", "#a89984", 246, 235],
["#a89984", "#504945", 239, 246],
["#a89984", "#3c3836", 237, 246],
["#665c54", 241],
["#282828", "#83a598", 235, 109],
["#282828", "#fe8019", 235, 208],
["#282828", "#8ec07c", 235, 108],
["#282828", "#689d6a", 235, 72],
["#282828", "#8f3f71", 235, 132],
]
```

### Tabline

Buffers will be listed on the tabline if there is only one tab, each item contains
the index, bufname and the filetype icon. If there are more than one tab, all
tabs will be listed on the tabline. Each item can be quickly accessed by using
`<Leader> number`. Default `<Leader>` is `\`.

| Key Bindings | Descriptions               |
| ------------ | -------------------------- |
| `<Leader> 1` | Jump to index 1 on tabline |
| `<Leader> 2` | Jump to index 2 on tabline |
| `<Leader> 3` | Jump to index 3 on tabline |
| `<Leader> 4` | Jump to index 4 on tabline |
| `<Leader> 5` | Jump to index 5 on tabline |
| `<Leader> 6` | Jump to index 6 on tabline |
| `<Leader> 7` | Jump to index 7 on tabline |
| `<Leader> 8` | Jump to index 8 on tabline |
| `<Leader> 9` | Jump to index 9 on tabline |
| `g r`        | Go to previous tab         |

SpaceVim tabline also supports mouse click, left mouse button will switch to buffer,
while middle button will delete the buffer.

**NOTE:** This feature is only supported in Neovim with `has('tablineat')`.

| Key Bindings     | Descriptions       |
| ---------------- | ------------------ |
| `<Mouse-left>`   | Jump to the buffer |
| `<Mouse-middle>` | Delete the buffer  |

**Tab manager:**

You can also use `SPC t t` to open the tab manager windows.

Key bindings within tab manager windows:

| Key Bindings      | Descriptions                              |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `o`               | Close or expand tab windows.              |
| `r`               | Rename the tab under the cursor.          |
| `n`               | Create new named tab below the cursor tab |
| `N`               | Create new tab below the cursor tab       |
| `x`               | Delete the tab                            |
| `Ctrl-Shift-Up`   | Move tab backward                         |
| `Ctrl-Shift-Down` | Move tab forward                          |
| `<Enter>`         | Jump to windows under the cursor.         |

### File tree

SpaceVim uses vimfiler as the default file tree, and the default key binding is `<F3>`.
And SpaceVim also provides `SPC f t` and `SPC f T` to open the file tree.

To change the filemanager plugin:

```toml
[options]
# file manager plugins supported in SpaceVim:
# - vimfiler (default)
# - nerdtree
# - defx
filemanager = "defx"
```

VCS integration is supported, there will be a column status, this feature may make vimfiler slow, so it is not enabled by default.
To enable this feature, add `enable_vimfiler_gitstatus = true` to your custom configure.
Here is a picture for this feature:

![file-tree](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13142418/80496111-5065b380-899b-11ea-95c7-02af4d304aaf.png)

There is also an option to config the direction of file tree, by default it is right. To move the file tree to the left,
you can use `filetree_direction` option:

```toml
[options]
filetree_direction = "left"
```

#### File tree navigation

Navigation is centered on the `hjkl` keys with the hope of providing a fast navigation experience like in [vifm](https://github.com/vifm):

| Key Bindings          | Descriptions                                      |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |

#### Open file with file tree.

If only one file buffer is opened, a file is opened in the active window, otherwise we need to use vim-choosewin to select a window to open the file.

| Key Bindings    | Descriptions                              |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `l` / `<Enter>` | open file in one window                   |
| `sg`            | open file in an vertically split window   |
| `sv`            | open file in an horizontally split window |

## General usage

The following key bindings are the general key bindings for moving cursor.

| `Ctrl-Shift-Down` | move lines down                          |

### Command line mode key bindings

After pressing `:`, you can switch to command line mode, here is a list of key bindings
can be used in command line mode:

| Key bindings   | Descriptions                         |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `Ctrl-a`       | move cursor to beginning             |
| `Ctrl-b`       | Move cursor backward in command line |
| `Ctrl-f`       | Move cursor forward in command line  |
| `Ctrl-w`       | delete a whole word                  |
| `Ctrl-u`       | remove all text before cursor        |
| `Ctrl-k`       | remove all text after cursor         |
| `Ctrl-c`/`Esc` | cancel command line mode             |
| `Tab`          | next item in popup menu              |
| `Shift-Tab`    | previous item in popup menu          |

### Mappings guide

A guide buffer is displayed each time the prefix key is pressed in normal mode. It lists the available key bindings and their short descriptions.
The prefix can be `[SPC]`, `[WIN]` and `<Leader>`.

The default keys of these prefixs are:

| Prefix name | Custom options and default values | Descriptions                        |
| ----------- | --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `[SPC]`     | NONE / `<Space>`                  | default mapping prefix of SpaceVim  |
| `[WIN]`     | `windows_leader` / `s`            | window mapping prefix of SpaceVim   |
| `<Leader>`  | default vim leader                | default leader prefix of vim/Neovim |

By default the guide buffer will be displayed 1000ms after the keys being pressed.
You can change the delay by adding vim option `'timeoutlen'` to your bootstrap function.

For example, after pressing `<Space>` in normal mode, you will see:

![mapping-guide](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13142418/25778673/ae8c3168-3337-11e7-8536-ee78d59e5a9c.png)

This guide shows you all the available key bindings begin with `[SPC]`, you can type `b` for all the buffer mappings, `p` for project mappings, etc.

After pressing `Ctrl-h` in guide buffer, you will get paging and help info in the statusline.

| Keys | Descriptions                  |
| ---- | ----------------------------- |
| `u`  | undo pressing                 |
| `n`  | next page of guide buffer     |
| `p`  | previous page of guide buffer |

Use `SpaceVim#custom#SPC()` to define custom SPC mappings. For instance:

```vim
call SpaceVim#custom#SPC('nnoremap', ['f', 't'], 'echom "hello world"', 'test custom SPC', 1)
```

**Fuzzy find key bidnings**

It is possible to search for specific key bindings by pressing `?` in the root of guide buffer.

To narrow the list, just insert the mapping keys or descriptions of what mappings you want, Unite/Denite will fuzzy find the mappings, to find buffer related mappings:

![unite-mapping](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13142418/25779196/2f370b0a-3345-11e7-977c-a2377d23286e.png)

Then use `<Tab>` or `<Up>` and `<Down>` to select the mapping, press `<Enter>` to execute that command.

### Editing

#### Text manipulation commands

Text related commands (start with `x`):

#### Text insertion commands

Text insertion commands (start with `i`):

| Key bindings | Descriptions                                                          |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |

#### Increase/Decrease numbers

| Key Bindings | Descriptions                                                        |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `SPC n +`    | increase the number under point by one and initiate transient state |
| `SPC n -`    | decrease the number under point by one and initiate transient state |

In transient state:

| Key Bindings  | Descriptions                           |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `+`           | increase the number under point by one |
| `-`           | decrease the number under point by one |
| Any other key | leave the transient state              |

**Tips:** You can increase or decrease a number by more than once by using a prefix argument (i.e. `10 SPC n +` will add 10 to the number under cursor).

#### Commenting

Comments are handled by [nerdcommenter](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdcommenter), it’s bound to the following keys.

| Key Bindings | Descriptions                                            |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |

**Tips:** `SPC ;` will start operator mode, in this mode, you can use motion command to comment lines.
For example, `SPC ; 4 j` will comment current line and the following 4 lines.

#### Multi-Encodings

SpaceVim uses utf-8 as default encoding. There are four options for these case:

- fileencodings (fencs): ucs-bom,utf-8,default,latin1
- fileencoding (fenc): utf-8
- encoding (enc): utf-8
- termencoding (tenc): utf-8 (only supported in Vim)

To fix messy display: `SPC e a` is the mapping for auto detect the file encoding. After detecting file encoding, you can run the command below to fix the encoding:

```vim
set enc=utf-8
write
```

### Window manager

Window manager key bindings can only be used in normal mode. The default leader `[WIN]` is `s`, you
can change it via `windows_leader` option:

```toml
[options]
windows_leader = "s"
```

| Key Bindings | Descriptions                          |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| `q`          | Smart buffer close                    |
| `WIN v`      | :split                                |
| `WIN V`      | Split with previous buffer            |
| `WIN g`      | :vsplit                               |
| `WIN G`      | Vertically split with previous buffer |
| `WIN t`      | Open new tab (:tabnew)                |
| `WIN o`      | Close other windows (:only)           |
| `WIN x`      | Remove buffer, leave blank window     |
| `WIN q`      | Remove current buffer                 |
| `WIN Q`      | Close current buffer (:close)         |
| `<Tab>`      | Next window or tab                    |
| `Shift-Tab`  | Previous window or tab                |

SpaceVim has mapped normal `q` as smart buffer close, the normal func of `q`
can be get by `<Leader> q r`, if you want to disable this feature, you can use `vimcompatible` mode.

### Available layers

All layers can be easily discovered via `:SPLayer -l` accessible with `SPC h l`.

**Available plugins in SpaceVim**

All plugins can be easily discovered via `<leader> l p`.

### Fuzzy finder

SpaceVim provides five fuzzy find tools, each of them is configured in a layer
(`unite`, `denite`, `leaderf`, `ctrlp` and `fzf` layer).
These layers have the same key bindings and features. But they need different dependencies.

Users only need to load one of these layers, they will be able to get these features.

for example, load the denite layer:

```toml
[[layers]]
name = "denite"
```

**Key bindings**

| Key bindings         | Discription                   |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `<Leader> f <Space>` | Fuzzy find menu:CustomKeyMaps |
| `<Leader> f p`       | Fuzzy find menu:AddedPlugins  |
| `<Leader> f e`       | Fuzzy find register           |

#### With an external tool

SpaceVim can be interfaced with different searching tools like:

- [rg - ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep)
- [ag - the silver searcher](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher)
- [pt - the platinum searcher](https://github.com/monochromegane/the_platinum_searcher)
- [ack](https://beyondgrep.com/)
- grep

The search commands in SpaceVim are organized under the `SPC s` prefix with the next key is the tool to use and the last key is the scope. For instance, `SPC s a b` will search in all opened buffers using `ag`.

If the last key (determining the scope) is uppercase then the current word under the cursor is used as default input for the search. For instance, `SPC s a B` will search the word under cursor.

If the tool key is omitted then a default tool will be automatically selected for the search. This tool corresponds to the first tool found on the system of the list `search_tools`, the default order is `rg`, `ag`, `pt`, `ack` then `grep`. For instance `SPC s b` will search in the opened buffers using `pt` if `rg` and `ag` have not been found on the system.

The tool keys are:

| Tool | Key |
| ---- | --- |
| ag   | a   |
| grep | g   |
| ack  | k   |
| rg   | r   |
| pt   | t   |

The available scopes and corresponding keys are:

| Scope                      | Key |
| -------------------------- | --- |
| opened buffers             | b   |
| buffer directory           | d   |
| files in a given directory | f   |
| current project            | p   |

It is possible to search in the current file by double pressing the second key of the sequence, for instance `SPC s a a` will search in the current file with `ag`.

Notes:

- `rg`, `ag` and `pt` are optimized to be used in a source control repository but they can be used in an arbitrary directory as well.
- It is also possible to search in several directories at once by marking them in the unite buffer.

**Beware** if you use `pt`, [TCL parser tools](https://core.tcl.tk/tcllib/doc/trunk/embedded/www/tcllib/files/apps/pt.html) also install a command line tool called `pt`.

#### Custom searching tool

To change the options of a search tool, you need to use the bootstrap function.
The following example shows how to change the default option of searching tool `rg`.

```vim
function! myspacevim#before() abort
let profile = SpaceVim#mapping#search#getprofile('rg')
let default_opt = profile.default_opts + ['--no-ignore-vcs']
call SpaceVim#mapping#search#profile({'rg' : {'default_opts' : default_opt}})
endfunction
```

The structure of searching tool profile is:

```vim
" { 'ag' : {
"   'namespace' : '',         " a single char a-z
"   'command' : '',           " executable
"   'default_opts' : [],      " default options
"   'recursive_opt' : [],     " default recursive options
"   'expr_opt' : '',          " option for enable expr mode
"   'fixed_string_opt' : '',  " option for enable fixed string mode
"   'ignore_case' : '',       " option for enable ignore case mode
"   'smart_case' : '',        " option for enable smart case mode
"   }
"  }
```

## Advanced usage

### Managing projects

SpaceVim will find the root of the project when a `.git` directory or a `.project_alt.json` file is encountered in the file tree.

Project manager commands start with `p`:

| Key Bindings | Descriptions                                          |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `SPC p '`    | open a shell in project’s root (need the shell layer) |

#### Searching files in project

| Key Bindings | Descriptions                             |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| `SPC p f`    | find files in current project            |
| `SPC p /`    | fuzzy search for text in current project |
| `SPC p k`    | kill all buffers of current project      |
| `SPC p t`    | find project root                        |
| `SPC p p`    | list all projects                        |

#### Custom alternate file

To manager the alternate file of the project, you need to create a `.project_alt.json` file
in the root of your project. Then you can use command `:A` to jump to the alternate file of
current file. You can also specific the type of alternate file, for example `:A doc`.
With a bang `:A!`, SpaceVim will parse the configuration file additionally. If no type specified,
the default type `alternate` will be used.

here is an example of `.project_alt.json`:

```json
{
  "autoload/SpaceVim/layers/lang/*.vim": {
    "doc": "docs/layers/lang/{}.md",
    "test": "test/layer/lang/{}.vader"
  }
}
```

### Bookmarks management

Bookmarks manager is included in `tools` layer, to use following key bindings, you need to enable
`tools` layer:

```toml
[[layers]]
name = "tools"
```

| Key Bindings | Descriptions                    |
| ------------ | ------------------------------- |
| `m a`        | Show list of all bookmarks      |
| `m m`        | Toggle bookmark in current line |
| `m n`        | Jump to next bookmark           |
| `m p`        | Jump to previous bookmark       |
| `m i`        | Annotate bookmark               |

As SpaceVim use above bookmarks mappings, so you cannot use `a`, `m`, `n`, `p` or `i` registers to mark current position, but other registers should work well.
If you really need to use these registers, you can map `<Leader> m` to `m` in your bootstrap function,
then you can use `a` registers via `<Leader> m a`.

```viml
function! myspacevim#before() abort
nnoremap <silent><Leader>m m
endfunction
```

### Tasks

To integrate with external tools, SpaceVim introduce a task manager system,
which is similar to vscode tasks-manager. There are two kinds of task configuration
file: global tasks configuration(`~/.SpaceVim.d/tasks.toml`) and local configuration(`.SpaceVim.d/tasks.toml`).

| Key Bindings | Descriptions                  |
| ------------ | ----------------------------- |
| `SPC p t e`  | edit tasks configuration file |
| `SPC p t r`  | select task to run            |

#### Task auto-detection

SpaceVim currently auto-detects tasks for npm.
the tasks manager will paser the `package.json` file for npm systems.
If you have cloned the [eslint-starter](https://github.com/spicydonuts/eslint-starter) example,
then pressing `SPC p t r` shows the following list:

![task-auto-detection](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13142418/75089003-471d2c80-558f-11ea-8aea-cbf7417191d9.png)

#### Task provider

Some tasks can be automatically detected by task provider. For example,
a Task Provider could check if there is a specific build file, such as `package.json`,
and create npm tasks.

To build a task provider, you need to use Bootstrap function. The task provider should be a vim function.
and return a task object.

here is an example for building task provider.

```vim
function! s:make_tasks() abort
    if filereadable('Makefile')
        let subcmd = filter(readfile('Makefile', ''), "v:val=~#'^.PHONY'")
        if !empty(subcmd)
            let commands = split(subcmd[0])[1:]
            let conf = {}
            for cmd in commands
                call extend(conf, {
                            \ cmd : {
                            \ 'command': 'make',
                            \ 'args' : [cmd],
                            \ 'isDetected' : 1,
                            \ 'detectedName' : 'make:'
                            \ }
                            \ })
            endfor
            return conf
        else
            return {}
        endif
    else
        return {}
    endif
endfunction
call SpaceVim#plugins#tasks#reg_provider(funcref('s:make_tasks'))
```

with above configuration, you will see following tasks in SpaceVim repo:

![task-make](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13142418/75105016-084cac80-564b-11ea-9fe6-75d86a0dbb9b.png)

#### Custom tasks

this is basic task configuration for running `echo hello world`, and print results to runner windows.

```toml
[my-task]
    command = 'echo'
    args = ['hello world']
```

![task hello world](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13142418/74582981-74049900-4ffd-11ea-9b38-7858042225b9.png)

To run task in the background, you need to set `isBackground` to `true`:

```toml
[my-task]
    command = 'echo'
    args = ['hello world']
    isBackground = true
```

The task's properties have the following semantic:

- **command**: the actual command to execute.
- **args**: the arguments passed to the command. can be omitted.
- **options**: override the defaults for `cwd`,`env` or `shell`.

SpaceVim supports variable substitution in task, The following predefined variables are supported:

- **\${workspaceFolder}**: - the project root directory
- **\${workspaceFolderBasename}**: - the parent directory name of current project root
- **\${file}**: - the path of current file
- **\${relativeFile}**: - the current file relative to project root
- **\${relativeFileDirname}**: - the current file's dirname relative to workspaceFolder
- **\${fileBasename}**: - the current file's basename
- **\${fileBasenameNoExtension}**: - the current file's basename without file extension
- **\${fileDirname}**: - the current file's dirname
- **\${fileExtname}**: - the current file's extension
- **\${cwd}**: - the task runner's current working directory on startup
- **\${lineNumber}**: - the current selected line number in the active file

for example: Supposing that you have the following requirements:

A file located at `/home/your-username/your-project/folder/file.ext` opened in your editor;
The directory `/home/your-username/your-project` opened as your root workspace.
So you will have the following values for each variable:

- **\${workspaceFolder}**: - `/home/your-username/your-project/`
- **\${workspaceFolderBasename}**: - `your-project`
- **\${file}**: - `/home/your-username/your-project/folder/file.ext`
- **\${relativeFile}**: - `folder/file.ext`
- **\${relativeFileDirname}**: - `folder/`
- **\${fileBasename}**: - `file.ext`
- **\${fileBasenameNoExtension}**: - `file`
- **\${fileDirname}**: - `/home/your-username/your-project/folder/`
- **\${fileExtname}**: - `.ext`
- **\${lineNumber}**: - line number of the cursor

### Replace text with iedit

SpaceVim uses a powerful iedit mode to quick edit multiple occurrences of a symbol or selection.

**Two new modes:** `iedit-Normal`/`iedit-Insert`

The default color for iedit is `red`/`green` which is based on the current colorscheme.

#### iedit states key bindings

**State transitions:**

| Key Bindings | From             | to           |
| ------------ | ---------------- | ------------ |
| `SPC s e`    | normal or visual | iedit-Normal |

**In iedit-Normal mode:**

`iedit-Normal` mode inherits from `Normal` mode, the following key bindings are specific to `iedit-Normal` mode.

| Key Binding   | Descriptions                                                                                                                       |

### Code runner and REPL

SpaceVim provides an asynchronously code runner plugin. In most language layer,
we have defined a key binding `SPC l r` for running current buffer.
If you need to add new commands, you can use the bootstrap function. For example:
Use `F5` to build project asynchronously.

```vim
nnoremap <silent> <F5> :call SpaceVim#plugins#runner#open('make')
```

These following features have been added to runner and repl plugin:

- Run current file with default command
- Run code file through system file explorer, only supported in gvim.
- Run code per Shebang
- Stop code running
- View output in Output Window
- Set default language to run
- Select language to run
- REPL support
- Run selected code snippet

### Highlight current symbol

SpaceVim supports highlighting of the current symbol on demand and add a transient state to easily navigate and rename these symbols.

It is also possible to change the range of the navigation on the fly to:

- buffer
- function
- visible area

To Highlight the current symbol under point press `SPC s h`.

Navigation between the highlighted symbols can be done with the commands:

| Key Bindings | Descriptions                                                                 |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `*`          | initiate navigation transient state on current symbol and jump forwards      |
| `#`          | initiate navigation transient state on current symbol and jump backwards     |
| `SPC s e`    | edit all occurrences of the current symbol                                   |
| `SPC s h`    | highlight the current symbol and all its occurrence within the current range |
| `SPC s H`    | go to the last searched occurrence of the last highlighted symbol            |

In highlight symbol transient state:

| Key Bindings  | Descriptions                                                  |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `e`           | edit occurrences (`*`)                                        |
| `n`           | go to next occurrence                                         |
| `N` / `p`     | go to previous occurrence                                     |
| `b`           | search occurrence in all buffers                              |
| `/`           | search occurrence in whole project                            |
| `<Tab>`       | toggle highlight current occurrence                           |
| `r`           | change range (function, display area, whole buffer)           |
| `R`           | go to home occurrence (reset position to starting occurrence) |
| Any other key | leave the navigation transient state                          |

### Errors handling

SpaceVim uses [neomake](https://github.com/neomake/neomake) to give error feedback on the fly.
The checks are only performed at save time by default.

Errors management mappings (start with e):

| Mappings  | Descriptions                                                                |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `SPC t s` | toggle syntax checker                                                       |
| `SPC e c` | clear all errors                                                            |
| `SPC e h` | describe a syntax checker                                                   |
| `SPC e l` | toggle the display of the list of errors/warnings                           |
| `SPC e n` | go to the next error                                                        |
| `SPC e p` | go to the previous error                                                    |
| `SPC e v` | verify syntax checker setup (useful to debug 3rd party tools configuration) |

The next/previous error mappings and the error transient state can be used to browse errors from syntax checkers as well as errors from location list buffers, and indeed anything that supports Vim's location list. This includes for example search results that have been saved to a location list buffer.

Custom sign symbol:

| Symbol | Descriptions | Custom options   |
| ------ | ------------ | ---------------- |
| `✖`    | Error        | `error_symbol`   |
| `➤`    | warning      | `warning_symbol` |
| `ⓘ`    | Info         | `info_symbol`    |

**quickfix list movement:**

| Mappings       | Descriptions                           |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `<Leader> q l` | Open quickfix list windows             |
| `<Leader> q c` | clear quickfix list                    |
| `<Leader> q n` | jump to next item in quickfix list     |
| `<Leader> q p` | jump to previous item in quickfix list |

### EditorConfig

SpaceVim has supported [EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org/), a configuration file to “define and maintain consistent coding styles between different editors and IDEs.”

To customize your editorconfig experience, read the [editorconfig-vim package’s documentation](https://github.com/editorconfig/editorconfig-vim/blob/master/README.md).

### Vim Server

SpaceVim starts a server at launch. This server is killed whenever you close your Vim windows.

**Connecting to the Vim server**

If you are using Neovim, you need to install [neovim-remote](https://github.com/mhinz/neovim-remote), then add this to your bashrc.

```sh
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.SpaceVim/bin
```

Use `svc` to open a file in the existing Vim server, or use `nsvc` to open a file in the existing Neovim server.
