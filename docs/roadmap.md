# Roadmap

The roadmap and [milestones](https://github.com/SpaceVim/SpaceVim/milestones) define the project direction and priorities.

## Current

### [0.4](https://github.com/SpaceVim/SpaceVim/milestone/7)

- Improve git work  flow
  - completion in commit message buffer
  - manager github issues annd PRs
- Improve autocomplete layer

## Meta

There are release milestones and meta milestones ("buckets"). 

- Version-number milestones (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, …) assign issues to production releases.
    - The nearest upcoming version is assigned a target date.
    - Low-risk fixes in the current branch are first committed to the stable branch, then merged to master. For example, if the current stable release is `0.1.1` and a bug-fix is assigned to the `0.2` milestone, it does not mean users need to wait until 0.2 to get the fix. The patch will be committed to the stable branch and released in `0.1.2`. 
- [todo](https://github.com/SpaceVim/SpaceVim/milestone/4) is a bucket for triaged tickets which should be on the roadmap but cannot yet be assigned to a concrete milestone.
- [unplanned](https://github.com/SpaceVim/SpaceVim/milestone/5) is a bucket for low-priority items or items lacking a feasible path to completion.
