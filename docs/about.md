## History

SpaceVim started in December 2016 as a spin-off from @wsdjeg's [DotFiles repository](https://github.com/wsdjeg/DotFiles).
An early idea for modular configuration came from the Vim configuration by airline's author.
The earliest version was further influenced by spacemacs' layer concept.

## Goals

- Mnemonic key bindings navigation
- More IDE-like features in both Vim and Neovim
- Better programming language support
- Cross-platform consistency
- Fast start up and efficient operation
