# About

## Version

[SpaceVim](https://github.com/SpaceVim/SpaceVim) is a community-driven vim distribution that supports vim and Neovim.  SpaceVim manages collections of plugins in layers.  Layers make it easy for you, the user, to enable a new language or feature by grouping all the related plugins together. It got inspired by spacemacs. 

## Goals

- Provide a consistent user experience across platforms.
- Provide better default layer for different languages.

## Principles

- Do not regress from origin
- Decide outcomes by weighing cost and benefit
- prefer usability over tradition if the benefits are overwhelming
- Give usability a chance
