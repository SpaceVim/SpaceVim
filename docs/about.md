# About

[SpaceVim](https://github.com/SpaceVim/SpaceVim) is a community-driven vim distribution with layer feature.
SpaceVim manages collections of plugins in layers. Layers make it easy for you, the user, to enable a new
language or feature by grouping all the related plugins together. It got inspired by spacemacs. 

### Goals

- more IDE-like features in vim and neovim
- better default different languages

### Principles

- Do not regress from origin
- Decide outcomes by weighing cost and benefit
- prefer usability over tradition if the benefits are overwhelming
- Give usability a chance
