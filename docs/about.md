# About

[SpaceVim](https://github.com/SpaceVim/SpaceVim) is a community-driven Vim distribution with layer feature.
SpaceVim manages collections of plugins in layers. Layers make it easy for you, the user, to enable a new
language or feature by grouping all the related plugins together. It got inspired by spacemacs.

### Goals

- More IDE-like features in Vim and Neovim
- Better default different languages
