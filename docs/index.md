# SpaceVim - Modern vim distribution 

SpaceVim is a distribution of the vim editor that's inspired by spacemacs.
It manages collections of plugins in layers, which help collect related
packages together to provide features. For example, the python layer collects
deoplete.nvim, neomake and jedi-vim together to provide autocompletion,
syntax checking, and documentation lookup. This approach helps keep
configuration organized and reduces overhead for the user by keeping them
from having to think about what packages to install.

If you like SpaceVim, feel free to star the project on github. It is a great way to show your
appreciation while providing us motivation to continue working on this project.
