# SpaceVim - Modern Vim distribution

SpaceVim is a distribution of the Vim editor that's inspired by spacemacs.
It manages collections of plugins in layers, which help to collect related
packages together to provide features. This approach helps keep the
configuration organized and reduces overhead for the user by keeping them
from having to think about what packages to install.

If you like SpaceVim, please feel free to star the project on [github](https://github.com/SpaceVim/SpaceVim). It is a great way to show your
appreciation while providing us motivation to continue working on this project.
