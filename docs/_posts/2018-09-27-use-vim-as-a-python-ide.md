# [Blogs](../blog/) >> Use Vim as a Python IDE

This is a general guide for using SpaceVim as a python IDE, including layer configuration and usage. 
Each of the following sections will be covered:

- [Code completion](#code-completion)
- [Syntax lint](#syntax-lint)

### Enable language layer

To add python language support in SpaceVim, you need to enable the `lang#python` layer. Press `SPC f v d` to open
SpaceVim configuration file, and add following configuration:

```toml
[[layers]]
  name = "lang#python"
```

for more info, you can read the [lang#python](../layers/lang/python/) layer documentation.

### Code completion

`lang#python` layer will load the jedi plugin automatically, unless overriden in your `init.toml`.
The completion menu will be opened as you type.

### Syntax linting

1. [neomake](https://github.com/neomake/neomake) - Asynchronous linting and make framework for Neovim/Vim

The javac maker in neomake supports maven projects, gradle projects or eclipse projects. You can also set the classpath.

### Import packages

When edit python file, you can import the package automatically, remove unused package and format package list.

```sh
pip install --user isort
```

### Jump to test file

SpaceVim use vim-project to manager the files in a project, you can add a `.projections.json` to the root of your project with following content:

```json
{
  "src/*.py": {"alternate": "test/{dirname}/{basename}Test.py"},
  "test/**/Test*.py": {"alternate": "src/{}.py"}
}
```

with this configuration, you can jump between the source code and test file via command `:A`



### running code

To run current script, you can press `SPC l r`, and a split windows
will be openen, the output of the script will be shown in this windows.
It is running asynchronously, and will not block your vim.

### Code formatting

1. [neoformat](https://github.com/sbdchd/neoformat) - A (Neo)vim plugin for formatting code.

For formatting java code, you also nEed have [uncrustify](http://astyle.sourceforge.net/) or [astyle](http://astyle.sourceforge.net/) in your PATH.
BTW, the google's [java formatter](https://github.com/google/google-java-format) also works well with neoformat.


### REPL

you need to install jdk9 which provide a build-in tools `jshell`, and SpaceVim use the `jshell` as default inferior REPL process:
