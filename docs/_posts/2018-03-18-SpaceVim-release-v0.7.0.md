## New features

- Highlight symbol mode [#1394](https://github.com/SpaceVim/SpaceVim/pull/1394)

SpaceVim supports highlighting of the current symbol on demand and adds
a transient state to easily navigate and rename this symbol.

- Iedit mode [#1258](https://github.com/SpaceVim/SpaceVim/pull/1258)

SpaceVim uses powerful iedit mode to quick edit multiple occurrences of a symbol or selection.

**Two new modes:** `iedit-Normal`/`iedit-Insert`

The default color for iedit is `red`/`green` which is based on the current colorscheme.
