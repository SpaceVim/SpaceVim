# [Blogs](../blog/) >> Use Vim as a Perl IDE

This is a general guide for using SpaceVim as a perl IDE, including layer configuration and usage. 
Each of the following sections will be covered:

- [Enable language layer](#enable-language-layer)
- [Code completion](#code-completion)
- [Syntax linting](#syntax-linting)
- [Jump to test file](#jump-to-test-file)
- [running code](#running-code)
- [Code formatting](#code-formatting)
- [REPL support](#repl-support)

### Enable language layer

To add perl language support in SpaceVim, you need to enable the `lang#perl` layer. Press `SPC f v d` to open
SpaceVim configuration file, and add following configuration:

```toml
[[layers]]
  name = "lang#perl"
```

for more info, you can read the [lang#perl](../layers/lang/perl/) layer documentation.

### Code completion

`lang#perl` layer will load the perl plugin automatically, unless overriden in your `init.toml`.
The completion menu will be opened as you type.

### Syntax linting

The checkers layer is enabled by default. This layer provides asynchronous syntax linting via [neomake](https://github.com/neomake/neomake).
It will run perl and perlcritic asynchronously.

Install perlcritic via cpan:

```sh
cpanm Perl::Critic
```

### Jump to test file

SpaceVim use built-in plugin to manager the files in a project, you can add a `.project_alt.json` to the root of your project with following content:

```json
{
  "src/*.pl": {"alternate": "test/{}.pl"},
  "test/*.pl": {"alternate": "src/{}.pl"}
}
```

with this configuration, you can jump between the source code and test file via command `:A`

### running code

To run current script, you can press `SPC l r`, and a split windows
will be openen, the output of the script will be shown in this windows.
It is running asynchronously, and will not block your vim.

### Code formatting

The format layer is also enabled by default, with this layer you can use key binding `SPC b f` to format current buffer.
Before using this feature, please install perltidy:

```sh
cpanm Perl::Tidy
```

### REPL support

Start a `perli` or  `perl -del` inferior REPL process with `SPC l s i`. After the REPL process has been started. you can 
send code to inferior process, all key bindings are begin with `SPC l s` prefix, including sending line, sending selection or even
send whole buffer.
