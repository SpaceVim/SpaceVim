# [Blogs](../blog/) >> # Mnemonic key bindings navigation

You don't need to remember any key bindings, as a guide buffer is displayed each time the prefix key is pressed
in normal/visual mode. It lists the available key bindings and their short description.

The prefix can be `[SPC]`, `[Window]`, `[denite]`, `<leader>` and `[unite]`, when the guide is opened, you can
see the prefix on the statusline. This will be shown in floating windows if your vim/neovim support this feature.

## default key binding prefixes

| Prefix name | custom option and default value   | description                         |
| ----------- | --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `[SPC]`     | NONE / `<Space>`                  | default mapping prefix of SpaceVim  |
| `[Window]`  | `g:spacevim_windows_leader` / `s` | window mapping prefix of SpaceVim   |
| `<leader>`  | `mapleader` / `` \ ``             | default leader prefix of vim/neovim |

By default the guide buffer will be displayed 1000ms after the key has been pressed. You can change the delay by setting `'timeoutlen'` option to your liking (the value is in milliseconds).

for example, after pressing `<Space>` in normal mode, you will see :

this guide show you all the available key bindings begin with `[SPC]`, you can type `b` for all the buffer mappings, `p` for project mappings, etc.

## Get paging and help info

after pressing `Ctrl-h` in guide buffer, you will get paging and help info in the statusline.
