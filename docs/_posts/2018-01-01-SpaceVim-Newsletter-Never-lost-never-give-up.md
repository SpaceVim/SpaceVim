# [newsletter](https://spacevim.org/development#newsletter) > Never lost, Never give up

Welcome to the second newsletter for SpaceVim, a project that hopes to turn vim into a modular IDE for most languages.

## What is SpaceVim

SpaceVim is a vim distribution which's inspired by spacemacs. It manages collection of plugins in layers, which help collect related packages together to provide features. For example, the [python layer](http://spacevim.org/layers/lang/python/) collects [deoplete.nvim](https://github.com/Shougo/deoplete.nvim/), [neomake](https://github.com/neomake/neomake) and [deoplete-jedi](https://github.com/zchee/deoplete-jedi) together to provides autocompletion, syntax checking, and documentation lookup. This approach helps keep configuration organized and reduces overhead for users by keeping them from having to think about what packages to install.

The development of SpaceVim happened on github: <https://github.com/SpaceVim/SpaceVim>.
